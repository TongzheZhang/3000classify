1	ABOUT US Since Dickow Pump Company Inc has been the NAFTA trading area distributor of Dickow Pumpen KG a family owned German pump company that began manufacturing pumps in Dickow pumps are working steadily and dependably in all corners of the globe As the technical world leader in magnetic drive pumps Dickow holds many patents is ISO certified and is a supplier partner of major chemical companies worldwide Dickow Pump specializes in supplying sealless metallic centrifugal multi stage centrifugal and side channel pumps with a magnetic coupling These are available in ANSI DIN and fully conform to API standards for sealless centrifugal pumps for petroleum heavy duty chemical and gas industry applications Conventionally sealed centrifugal multi stage centrifugal side channel and API pumps are also available in DIN and fully conform to many of the API plans All units are carefully sized and built to the customer s particular fluid hydraulic requirements and condition point Dickow pumps are not mass produced but rather are manufactured to the highest standards for very specific chemical environments and applications Our Marietta GA location stocks some commonly used pump types and sizes and an extensive array of replacement parts Our repair facility is able to repair or rebuild any Dickow Pump THE DICKOW ADVANTAGE DICKOW S MAGNETIC COUPLING The main advantage of the magnetic coupling is that the liquid pumped is hermetically sealed from the atmosphere The driving power of the motor is transferred from the outer magnets through the containment shell to the inner magnet which is connected via a shaft to the impeller The inner and outer magnets are synchronously connected meaning the pump speed is equal to the motor speed Dickow s standard containment shell is made from Hastelloy which reduces eddy currents Pumps can also be supplied with ceramic shells as well as with shells constructed of titanium and peek materials which create no eddy currents We also offer two segmented containment shells for the largest magnetic couplings available Dickow continually tests different materials and pump configurations as we are always seeking ways to improve our products and meet new challenges WEAR RESISTANT SIC SLIDE BEARINGS Dickow uses Silicon Carbide SIC as a slide bearing material due to its very high hardness and excellent corrosion and wear resistance This material allows applications in all kinds of liquids such as solvents acids hydroxides and more The sleeve type SIC bearings located in the fluid require no lubrication only a stable fluid film between the surfaces similar to the situation between seal faces COOLING OF THE MAGNETIC COUPLING AND HYDRAULICALLY BALANCED THRUST LOADS All magnetically coupled centrifugal pumps require the heat associated from the eddy currents to be dissipated The Dickow design takes fluid from the pump discharge and circulates it back to the magnets where a rear impeller increases the pressure and through some channels in the bearing housing returns it to the discharge This arrangement does not have any effect on the suction conditions Thrust can be a major concern with all mag drive pumps since the pump shaft is not connected to the motor Dickow addresses this issue with a unique pump design where the rear impeller pushes opposite of the pump impeller thus hydraulically balancing the thrust load This in turn provides for no wear of the SIC start up rings or the slide bearings STANDARD MATERIALS Standard materials for casings and wetted parts include Cast Iron Ductile Iron Carbon Steel Stainless Steel and Hastelloy C Optional materials include Duplex Stainless Steel Alloy and others on request Count on Dickow Pumps for quality reliability and longevity in service for your toughest chemical processing environments because performance is everything

transfer equipment for a wide range of commercial and industrial applications Today Fulton employs more than people in facilities in five countries and has served as an industry leader of emerging heat technologies for more than years Family Heritage Global Manufacturing Expanding Capabilities Focused on the Future PURE Technology Lewis Palm Family Heritage Fulton s founder Lewis Palm was a pioneer in the engineering of steam equipment for the laundry and dry cleaning markets In a small garage next to his home in Fulton New York Lewis invented the first Vertical Tubeless Boiler in Upon the receipt of his first sale Lewis tied the boiler to the trunk of his car and drove it hundreds of miles from New York to Michigan Within just a few short years this same boiler would become the most popular model on the market for dry cleaners and launderers nationally and the company founded as a result of that first sale would include approximately employees and a manufacturing facility in Oswego New York The highly skilled staff who fabricated Fulton boilers were ingenuity experts producing an extraordinarily high number of boilers annually approximately in an era before high tech tools and technology were implemented to streamline production The latest innovations and newest technologies continued to capture Lewis interest and steered the direction of Fulton s growth Meanwhile Lewis son Ronald had entered the family business with an eye for expanding product lines In the s Ronald began to develop a version of a thermal fluid heater that was to be the backbone of emerging growth at Fulton Ronald s heater incorporated the interaction of fluid spinning at high velocity with high spin flame hooked up to a hose to monitor the progression of fluid entry Eventually he integrated coils into the design obtained a patent and founded Fulton Thermal Corporation Inc in Lewis grandson and Ronald s son Bram joined the team in the s bringing a third generation of renewed dedication to innovative technologies at Fulton Bram continues to place a strong emphasis on Research Development energy efficiencies global impact and environmental responsibility Back to Top Global

Canada with the founding of Fulton Boiler Works Canada in Toronto Fulton continued its interest in global markets with a venture into Asia in the s In Fulton China in Hangzhou was founded with further Chinese growth in with Fulton Ningbo Fulton China facilities today contribute approximately square feet of manufacturing space to the company Additional growth of Fulton holdings came by way of the purchase of Volcanic Heater in Primarily located in Alliance Ohio Volcanic is a premier manufacturer of heaters for both marine and land based customers Fulton s product offerings during this time had grown to range from steam and hydronic boilers to thermal fluid heaters with a large array of ancillary equipment In an effort to fulfill the growing need for systems integration and controls Fulton

1	Dolphin Products has evolved over the years from T B Exotic Fish a chain of aquarium shops named for Tom Barbara Briscall As we grew we started looking to filtration needs of aquariums and ponds What we saw was a lack of reliable pumps and fish friendly and human friendly chemicals and additives We looked to the water purification industry and with the help of a microbiology lab developed a line of truly effective products which promote a very healthy environment for both pond and aquarium fishes These products have also become very important in commercial applications protecting systems from the harmful effects of ammonia during the periods of population fluctuations Thus was born the Dolphin Pharmaceuticals Division of Dolphin Aquarium Pet products During the seventies we noticed that the pumps that we were marketing were inefficient and had relatively short life spans In addition the high noise levels heat transfer and low volume turnover of magnetic drive pumps adde to the overall cost of ownership High speed direct drive pumps had their place and also had the higher noise levels and heat issues In reviewing the needs of the industry we threw out the current thinking and developed a new type of pump which would move high volumes of water while consuming low amounts of current In the late s The Dolphin Pumps Division developed the unique approach of utilizing low rpm motors with wide high horsepower impellers This created the first quiet cool running high volume aquarium and pond pump Over the years we have continued the development of our pumps and continue to use the best materials available Of course like other pumps back then there was room for improvement We did not want Dolphin s brand to stagnate and we felt the to keep improving Through dedicated research while other manufacturers stayed with status quo we solved any possible pump failure issues The Dolphin Diamond series pumps are designed to provide up to and over a decade of maintenance free service even in the most abrasive reef environment Our confidence is evident in our warranty
