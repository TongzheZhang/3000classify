how we can help you Noteworth Industry News The wastewater industry has seen tough times in recent years with a combination of low flow urinals and toilets in combination with flushable items This is the latest in examples of how this impacts our municipal systems From ABC News Picture Flushability of Wipes Spawns Class Action Lawsuit March By U JIN LEE Flushable wipes have caused problems in New York City wastewater treatment plants NYC Environmental Protection A New York doctor has filed a federal class action lawsuit against the makers of flushable wipes after experiencing what he claims were major plumbing and clogging issues in his home The defendants should have known that their representations regarding flushable wipes were false and misleading the complaint states The lawsuit by Dr Joseph Kurtz who lives in Brooklyn N Y cites Kimberly Clark and Costco Wholesale corporations and seeks damages of at least million The suit filed on Feb in the Eastern District of New York represents people and claims that consumers around the country have suffered through clogged pipes flooding jammed sewers and problems with septic tanks due to the use of flushable wipes The lawsuit is the latest complaint against the flushable wipes in recent years Over the past five to six years New York City's Department of Environmental Protection has spent over million to have these wipes removed by hand from the sewer system according to Deputy Commissioner Vincent Sapienza When the department looked at the sales of flushable wipes Sapienza said that there was almost a direct correlation between an increase in product sales and an increase in clogs within its sewage treatment facilities The word flushable means it won t clog your toilet or your house but when it gets to a sewage treatment plant the wipes wrap around the equipment shuts it down and then the treatment plant workers go and manually pull these wipes out Sapienza told ABC News on Monday The agency recommends that people not flush these wipes and instead throw them out in the garbage can The wipes market is a billion a year industry with sales growing by to percent annually according to court papers In response to this federal lawsuit Bob Brand a spokesperson for Kimberly Clark the makers of Cottonelle wipes said Kimberly Clark has an extensive testing process to ensure that our flushable wipes products meet or exceed all industry guidelines and we stand behind our claims of flushability A Costco official told ABC News that Costco does not comment on lawsuits While the cleansing cloth packages are labeled as flushable and sewer and septic safe the lawsuit states that there are no legal requirements that a product must meet in order to claim that it is flushable and only voluntary guidelines may be followed at the discretion of manufacturers Experts running public wastewater facilities have independently tested the wipes because there is no legal standard We started doing testing ourselves because we couldn t get any information from the manufacturers said Rob Villee executive director of the Plainfield Area Regional Sewerage Authority in New Jersey Villee who has been working on the testing of these wipes for four years said that when the wipes were put in liters of water the Cottonelle wipes took minutes to disperse while the Costco wipes even after three hours were not totally broken up and there was no noticeable loss of mass Unlike the Cottonelle brand that uses a water soluble binder that breaks down when put in water the Costco brand has a plastic backing sheet on the wipes Villee said I flushed that sucker down times and it still held together he said The Water Environment Federation and the American Public Works Association both nonprofit groups that deal with wastewater issues are expected to meet later this year with product manufacturers to jointly determine what the term flushable should mean Villee said The groups also expected to do more testing on the wipes he said

2	 Water treatment and equipment Lowara water pumps ITT Lowara regional distributors for pumps pumping equipment and spare parts Now part of the Zylem group We are official distributors of ITT Lowara pumps and pumping systems Lowara pumps are highly regarded for their reliability efficiency and low running costs We have direct access to the stock and spares lists reducing time for repairs and replacement so you can get back to business and production as soon as possible Some of the types of pumps we can provide are end suction centrifugal close coupled inline pumps multi stage submersible drainage and sewage borehole booster sets and variable speed As we are direct distributors an out of hour s technical advice line is also available Aquada UV Sterilisers We supply and fit UV lamps to control bacteria mainly in spring and borehole water They come in a range of sizes from small domestic to large industrial A UV lamp is of great importance when water which is to be used for human consumption does not come direct from the water undertakers main supply i e it comes from a spring or a borehole Normally a small particle filter will be fitted before the lamp this reduces sediment in the water so the UV rays can penetrate the water to be treated the light then neutralises the bugs and bacteria This is vital because you can t always assume because your water comes from a freshwater spring or bore hole that it is of drinking quality If you own or manage a commercial premises you will usually receive a visit from the local council or Environment Agency who will take water samples and inform you of the water quality and if it is safe to drink Or you may have a private residential home and be cautious of the water supply or even be buying bottled water for drinking and cooking can you really afford to take the risk of poor water quality with your business or home UV sterilizers are easy to fit and as borehole water and spring water is usually free comparatively cheep to buy Private water supplies are covered by the Private water Supply Regulations we can assist you with compliance with this code Water softeners We supply install and service commercial and domestic softeners to suit all applications Simplex duplex time clock and meter controlled softeners Water softeners work by a process known as iron exchange The hard water passes through a high quality cation exchange resin column inside a pressure vessel The resin removes the positively charged Calcium and Magnesium ions from solution and exchanges them for ions of Sodium When the Sodium Irons have been exchanged for Calcium or Magnesium the resin must be regenerated by recharging it using sodium Irons This is a flushing method using salt solution brine this program can be set to happen as and when required Alternatively a meter controlled head can be fitted to ensure regeneration takes place as and when required We also carry out all aspects of service and repair of Siata Fleck Autotrol and Clack valves Resin bed cleaning disinfection including new resin beds if required On site testing for soft water Supply of pre packaged salt Water rams A little known fact regarding water rams is that they use downhill pressure to pump water much higher than it originally started with no other power needed A ft fall is enough to push water up ft above the source These pumps are ideal for rural sites both domestic and commercial Although water rams have been around for hundreds of years and their main design has changed very little they are highly effective and are ideal for environmental use It is a misconception that ram pumps are noisy this is true some are but we can now supply and fit High Lifter Ram Pumps which are considerably quieter it has to be said with these type of pumps the water needs to be cleaner and grit free than for a normal ram If the ram pump you are currently using is faulty we are able to recondition and service it we even make parts for some of the older obsolete pumps in our own workshops Hydraguard is currently a stockist for Blake s and Hydram Water Rams High purity water plant This is either provided by a series of vessels and chemicals or now more commonly via reverse osmosis This is done by filtering the water to be treated through a series of membranes the size of the membrane depends entirely on he clients requirements of water quality This process also reduces the requirement for the use of chemicals to treat water making it more environmentally friendly In many cases after water has passed through a reverse osmosis plant it can either be discharged down a sewer or used in other processes this obviously reduces operating costs by using recycled not raw water Reverse osmosis plants are usually specified with pre treatment forms or process such as softening the water to prevent the membranes scaling up cartridge filters to remove small particles and carbon filtration to remove chlorine All reverse osmosis plants are manufactured to provide a dedicated function for the client and come in various forms of packages and sizes a full range of support and service can also be provided Filtration Designed for specific requirements of domestic or process work Cartridge sand or backwashable resin bed systems From a simple cartridge filter to a large bespoke system capable of several thousand tonnes of water per hour Hydraguard have the expertise to help All parts and spares from stock GRP tank lids Manufacturer of made to measure sectional GRP tank lids and access hatches to enable existing tanks to comply with current ACOP L legislation the current legislation requires all CWST s are fitted with lids and for the larger tanks a man way access hatch as well We provide a range of made to measure lids this is one of our most popular products or services because by law the tanks must conform to the water regulations

2	 INTEGRATED PUMP TECHNOLOGY APPOINTED EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR FOR GRINDEX IN SOUTHERN AFRICA SEPTEMBER ADMIN Integrated Pump Technology has been appointed as the exclusive distributor in southern Africa for Grindex the world s third largest submersible pump manufacturer with effect from July Located in Bartlett Boksburg IPT is a pump focused business delivering an improved all round service to its customers It will assume responsibility for the development of the Grindex business in a number of high potential African countries Integrated Pump Technology already has the expertise infrastructure and capabilities to service long standing Grindex customers while growing its pump installation base further Graham Russell executive chairman says Grindex has had a presence in South Africa since the late s most recently through Voith Turbo Our first job since acquiring the agency is to assure the market that it is business as usual We guarantee relationship product service and price structure continuity Integrated Pump Technology is delighted to continue the long association with Grindex in South Africa where it is a household name and we look forward to the challenge of growing the brand in Africa Russell says Russell and his Integrated Pump Technology team consisting of sales service and administration personnel understand the Grindex product range fully The team is fully committed to building on the Grindex success story in Africa he says Located in a new industrial business park close to OR Tambo International Airport Integrated Pump Technology boasts a newly built m warehouse and offices The Grindex certified warehouse holds a comprehensive stock inventory acquired from Voith as well as encompassing a full service repair and kW test tank facility We have an established distribution network of strategically located and specialised pump companies and key account managers whose proximity to our end users provide a fast personal service The warehouse supports the distribution structure in terms of sales repairs and rentals to Botswana Namibia Zambia the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC Mozambique and Zimbabwe Integrated Pump Technology will use its new facility to develop its rental model a new development for Grindex in this market We see the rental business as a big opportunity and are building a significant rental stockholding to service this sector Russell says He explains that Integrated Pump Technology s strategy furthermore is to develop broader product lines and niche non competing premium brands It will also grow the Grindex footprint in a range of industries from mining to construction in keeping with its market segmentation internationally The South African and sub Saharan African markets were the largest export markets for Grindex in and and the second largest in This year is already looking exceptionally good for us driven largely by our exports to Zambia and the DRC There is a full service and test facility in Zambia We are hoping to regain our number one position this year and look on track to do so Russell says Recent flagship contracts include the supply of highly wear resistant Bravo submersible slurry pumps to the DRC and a further submersible Mega N pumps to Zambia In South Africa Grindex has enjoyed a number of successful demonstration test trials in pond dewatering applications in Rustenburg and Richards Bay Research and development takes place at the Grindex head office in Sweden from where new generation pumps are introduced to the market regularly In order to keep up to date with new product lines and innovations Integrated Pump Technology will provide distributor and employee training once a year We will also take our distributors and staff to the Grindex factory in Sweden where they will have access to further training A Grindex representative based in South Africa will provide seamless interaction and communication with Sweden says Russell The main innovations of the Grindex dewatering products are the capability of the sub kW range to run dry This is due to a unique air valve integrated into the pump which allows the impeller to pass air instead of water past the motor in a dry run condition The patented smart motor protector ensures thermal overload phase loss and phase rotation protection The protector and all associated electrical switchgear are installed inside the pump itself meaning there is no need for a control panel with the added benefit of being able to run the pump without supervision The Grindex sludge range has all the advantages of the dewatering range coupled with a recessed vortex impeller and a split hydraulic with replaceable polyurethane linings This makes the sludge units capable of greater solids handling with increased abrasion resistance The lightweight aluminium construction means that these highly portable and robust pumps are ideal for underground face dewatering The dewatering and sludge pumps are also available in cast stainless steel with a capacity of handling pH values between and which means they are ideal for process applications Grindex also manufactures a range of pedigree slurry pumps Boasting a total hard chrome construction of the wet end these units are designed to move medium to heavy slurries with high abrasive content without sacrificing efficiency abrasion resistance or production downtime

2	 History This is a story of engineering genius upon which Marshall Engineered Product's MEPCO line of superior Steam and Hydronic Specialties was built started in After years of growth and prosperity the company wrote to Purdue University seeking to hire their top engineering student That student was David Nelson Crosthwait Jr a person who had earned both his B S and Masters of Engineering from Purdue A few months later Mr David Crosthwait's long and distinguished career as one of the foremost inventors and authorities on heat transfer ventilation and air conditioning began at MEPCO Mr Crosthwait as director of research invented an improved boiler a new thermostat control and a new differential vacuum pump allowing more effective heating systems in larger buildings He became well known for his innovations to heating and ventilation problems Mr Crosthwait was commissioned to design the heating system for Radio City Music Hall in New York City Over the course of his career Mr Crosthwait received U S and foreign patents and authored a manual on heating and cooling with water guides standards and codes that dealt with heating ventilation refrigeration and air conditioning systems After retiring in Mr Crosthwait taught a course on steam heating theory at Purdue University until his passing in Mr Crosthwait was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Purdue in for his lifetime achievements He was also named a Fellow of the AAAS served as a member of the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers and the National Society of Professional Engineers Mr Crosthwait is also listed as one of the Top Black Scientists in America The world of heating began to move away from steam which dominated central heating due to its inherent ability to travel through a system by its own kinetic energy giving way to Hydronic Technologies The steam produced by boilers could also be used to supply domestic hot water while hot water boilers were being introduced to share common distribution systems with the new chilled water Air Conditioning Systems With an eye toward these changes the company embraced the new field and put their engineering staff to work on the task of pump and hydronic specialty design Soon the brass foundry that had supported the company with trap and valve castings had a new product to pour pump impellers machined to gleaming perfection with unmatched craftsmanship to design specifications still exclusive to MEPCO While times have changed and CAD drawings have long since replaced hand drawn ink on velum documentation the values of innovation quality and longevity established long ago continue to be the guiding principles behind every product line engineered manufactured and sold by MEPCO From the first thermostatic trap perfected in has come the industry's oldest line of designs proven and tested in hundreds of thousands of buildings worldwide From low pressure comfort to industrial process applications MEPCO produces the depth and range of products to answer your steam and hydronic system requirements Founded on engineering innovation our company continues to produce the lasting quality and operational longevity that exceeds the working expectations of other brands MEPCO has retained the industry's best and most consistent sales representatives for generations With more than eight million products installed in schools hospitals government and process facilities worldwide specify Marshall Engineered Products Company when you want the best And remember that when you call a Marshall Engineered Products Company Independent Sales Office you will speak to a representative who has been trained in the science of steam Our products include Thermostatic Radiator Valves Float Thermostatic Traps Regulating Valves Radiator Valves Strainers Inverted Bucket Traps Thermodynamic Traps Thermostatic Traps Vacuum Breakers Centrifugal Pumps Regenerative Turbine Pumps Converters Suction Diffusers Triple Duty Valves Air Separators Expansion Tanks and so much more 
2	 To our people in the HVAC trade I was born and raised in the heating business It s in my blood I really love it Over the years I have worked as a salesman at the retail wholesale manufacturer rep and factory level I have cleaned oil burners driven oil trucks and installed heaters and controls I have learned what people like and what really gets them mad For quite some time I called on wholesalers representing Honeywell controls I became increasingly dissatisfied with the way customers were being handled untrained countermen inside salesmen with no motivation to satisfy problems and owners not willing to pay enough money to hire train and keep qualified people W Kerk Farrell President NECCI decided to do something about it In we started a distributorship specializing in servicing commercial customers It seemed that full line distributors couldn t spend enough time on each product to develop an expertise better than fair or average Customers deserved better service and weren t getting it I felt that with the state of the art changing so rapidly a specialty distributor for commercial controls was badly needed We hired knowledgeable factory trained sales engineers to staff the inside positions and the results were spectacular In a few short years we have grown twenty fold and are rapidly increasing yearly We have built our entire philosophy on a What does the customer want attitude We won t stop asking now and won t ever take your repeat business for granted If you re going to trust us with your orders we have to respond by earning them every time If you ever get what you think is less than excellent customer service call me or email me personally and I ll take corrective action Note If you really liked how you were treated I would love to know that too Or tell someone else

2	 Power Equipment Direct was first conceived by Jon Hoch the company's founder after an awful experience shopping for a lawnmower in Hoch wasted an entire Saturday and in gas driving between a half dozen big box superstores and local hardware stores trying to purchase the perfect lawnmower Big Bust The big box stores had a huge selection of lawnmowers collecting dust in a mammoth warehouse After hiking nearly a mile to find the right aisle Hoch finally found the lawnmowers hoisted two stories in the air He tried to round up a sales person to help bring one down so he could read the information on the box The first two ran and hid The third one didn't have a clue He then tried deciphering what remained of the tattered marketing materials which was nearly impossible without being trampled on by the other customers Peaceful Overpriced Frustrated he climbed back into his tiny Saturn and drove across town to the local hardware store to find some solitude That's about all he found Premiere hardware store carried a handful of lawnmowers but the model that he wanted was overpriced and sold out Great He finally found the product he wanted albeit for too much but he couldn't even buy it So he drove to the same store in the next town to purchase it Apparently everyone else in the area had the same idea The store just sold the last one an hour earlier Even if the store had the merchandise Hoch realized that he probably couldn't fit the huge box into his little sedan without scratching half the paint off the door frame Exhausted from shopping Hoch special ordered an overpriced lawnmower paid an enormous amount sales tax and a huge service charge to have it shipped to his house He realized that there's got to be a better way The Birth of a New Company Power Equipment Direct was founded on the premise of simplified shopping Customers could sort through all of the leading power equipment products online from the comfort of their homes no traffic jams no crowds no scratched tailgates Plus all of the equipment including hard to find accessories would ship directly from the factory to the customer's door eliminating the need for stores warehouses and clueless clerks Power Equipment Direct streamlined the sales process and rewarded customers with factory direct discounts and a sales tax free guarantee on its vast selection of products Hoch launched his first web store PressureWashersDirect com from his basement in The goal To sell one pressure washer a week in order to make a car payment Several years and a couple of web stores later Power Equipment Direct is one of the leading online power equipment e tailers with millions of dollars in annual sales The company owns more than a dozen power equipment related web addresses and plans to open more specialty superstores in the very near future

2	 WHY SIMPLE PUMP FOR RIGHT NOW to protect your family against grid equipment failures hurricanes tornadoes floods forest fires ice snow and wind storms FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE PROBLEMS political unrest emps worsening climate attack and more IN THINKING ABOUT PURCHASING THE SIMPLE PUMP THERE ARE TWO MAIN QUESTIONS Why buy ANY backup pump at all Then if buying a hand pump why buy a Simple Pump rather than one of the competition WHY BUY ANY HAND PUMP AT ALL There are many current circumstances that make having a hand pump a very good idea We have had customers tell us about getting through the aftermath of ice storms snow storms tornados hurricanes floods and forest fires with their Simple Pump Living rurally it s not a matter of IF the power goes out it s WHEN and FOR HOW LONG Just the last decade has seen people over wide areas being without power for weeks and even as much as months And of course there are more serious possible reasons to think about in the future political economic climactic grid and astronomical circumstances that could seriously interfere with our lives and wellbeing Buying a manual pump is like insurance Except instead of having to pay again every year it s a one time payment And the insurance is for something far more important than our car or our house WHY BUY A SIMPLE PUMP RATHER THAN ONE OF THE COMPETITION BECAUSE IT'S BY FAR THE MOST CAPABLE HAND PUMP ON THE MARKET AT A PRICE NO OTHER SERIOUS PUMP CAN MATCH GIVES YOU FULL NORMAL USE OF ALL YOUR HOME'S TAPS AND PLUMBING FIXTURES EVEN FROM DEEP WELLS Simple Pump pumps into pressure the pressurized water tank of your home's plumbing system and gives you full use of ALL your household plumbing year round IN ANY CLIMATE MUCH EASIER TO PUMP Some of our clients have replaced working pumps of other kinds because the Simple Pump is SO much easier to use Remember slamming older car doors compared to the gentle pull needed for a modern door That's the difference that computer controlled machining and modern materials make And Simple Pump is THE ONLY HAND PUMP made with computer controlled machining Read one client's story CAN PUMP FROM MUCH FURTHER DOWN Our low effort pumping also means we can pump from further down FAR beyond the reach of any other hand pump As far as feet water level FITS IN THE MAJORITY OF WELLS ALONGSIDE THE SUBMERSIBLE Needs only or clearance IN SUMMARY THE ALTERNATIVES AMOUNT TO Either cheaper pumps with MUCH less capability Or other serious pumps with similar output and support beyond feet but which are considerably more expensive than the Simple Pump and require enormously greater pumping effort The Simple Pump IS by far the most capable hand pump on the market and yet it's available at a price no other serious pump can match RELATED LINKS CLIENT STORIES
