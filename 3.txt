3	Types of Service Anaconda Protective Concepts The truth about service Many companies will tell you they are the only ones that can inspect test maintain and service equipment That their equipment is proprietary and that only they can service it You hear words like sole sourcing and exclusive capability That is not always true At Anaconda we even have some equipment that is proprietary But the truth is this many of the devices attached to proprietary equipment the wiring connections horns strobes detectors pull stations and other supervisory equipment they all can be generic equipment used on a large variety of systems So yes we can inspect test maintain and service most requirements of the systems All of this is in accordance with state and local code requirements In fact the large majority of inspection and testing has nothing to do with the proprietary functions of the equipment There can be programming requirements that are proprietary in nature and that we may not have access to but that does not negate our ability to provide a large part of the service Make sure to talk to us about each system s requirements and what we can do for you such as the inspections testing service and deficiency repairs What is the Anaconda difference Here at Anaconda long term relationships with our customers are what is most important That is why everyone in our organization is charged with providing excellent service along with helping our clients with their requests as much as possible The honest truth is that other companies will promise you everything And I know given that kind of promise is hard to deliver But what I can tell you is this we will do everything we can to meet and to exceed your expectations Your safety and comfort depend on that And we depend on you That is why we want you to be part of the Anaconda Protective Concepts partnership And we want to be your team member Thanks for trusting Anaconda Don Dunfee

3	Pump Meter Service Petroleum Equipment and Pump Meter Service Inc history goes back to when a south Minneapolis Minnesota mechanic named Cliff Price began servicing and repairing gas pumps for the local service station market His petroleum fueling service business slowly grew through the Great Depression and as time went on he added several employees Howard Abel from Buffalo Minnesota was one of the hired employees and is significant because he remained a full time employee of Pump Meter Service until when he retired After retiring he worked part time until his death in Abel was just one example of the rich history of great people Pump Meter Service has employed over its year history of petroleum fueling service Cofounders Cliff Price Lee Radermacher Cliff Price the Founder sold out to Ken Wanner in and the petroleum service company was renamed Price Wanner Inc Cliff stayed on as a mentor for the new manager Lee Radermacher until Ken Wanner sold the company to form a group of investors This group went on to become Arrow Tank Company which still exists today in Cambridge Minnesota Cliff Price and Lee Radermacher reacquired complete ownership and renamed the company Pump Meter Service Inc in At this time Pump Meter Service was located at East Franklin in South Minneapolis Cliff continued to serve as a partner and mentor to Lee As time went on the young and eager Lee Radermacher began taking on more responsibilities and assumed more of an active role in Pump Meter Service s direction At the time Pump Meter Service was largely a petroleum service company for several major oil companies They also provided petroleum services to other companies in the Twin Cities such as Northwest Service Station Equipment and Oil Equipment Both these companies sold equipment and hired Pump Meter Service to do the equipment installations By Lee had complete ownership and began a growth process with steady increases in sales year by year Sadly Cliff Price passed away that same year However his tradition of a small family business with quality people was well implanted into Lee s business strategy after years with such an experienced partner in the petroleum service industry In the early years all gas pump lines were serviced and parts were obtained either directly from the factory or from the local distributor Pump Meter Service was a Bowser pump distributor in the fifties and early sixties which at the time was a substantial gas pump manufacturer owned by Keene Corp In Gilbert and Barker Inc later Gilbarco approached Pump Meter Service about becoming a Gilbarco distributor Gilbarco was a strong pump line in the East and South but Bowser was floundering Gilbarco had an almost non existent market share in Minnesota Pump Meter Service took on the Gilbarco line and in conjunction with new and innovative products from Gilbarco proceeded to become the number one petroleum pump line in the Twin Cities This was accomplished not only because of a great product but more importantly by a strong service support network and the assurances from Pump Meter Service to back up its petroleum service products This fact is slowly being lost in today's world of incremental market share and big box sellers As time went on other excellent petroleum equipment lines were added such as Graco Rotary Lift Veeder Root Red Jacket LSI Containment Solutions Xerxes OPW and Franklin Fueling to name a few Pump Meter Service kept adding quality employees who remain to this day the cornerstone of its success In and Lee's sons Joe Radermacher and Tom Radermacher joined the family business bringing engineering and professional talents to the firm which allowed Lee to reduce his time commitment Several key employees were on board at that time namely Ron Komis and Stan Biggen Several more would follow in the ensuing years Mike Eicher Art Staaf Cheryl Simpson Don Krushke Ron Smith Sparky Bejin and numerous others too lengthy to list here Pump Meter Service is very proud of their employees a big change from the five employees they started with in In Pump Meter Service was relocated to its present location in Hopkins Minnesota Woodrich Construction sold out allowing Pump Meter Service to expand on acres In a square foot warehouse and service building was added to the existing sqare foot bldg In a buyout agreement was written between Lee and his two sons and was finalized in Lee after great years retired and now spends the winters at his Arizona home and summers in Minnesota Now a third generation is taking the reins at Pump and Meter Service Inc Kurt Radermacher Joe's son has taken an active role in Sales Management A graduate of Purdue University with a degree in business Kurt brings fresh new energy to sales and marketing He is assembling a new young team in Sales Service and Construction and expanding branch operations in Chippewa Falls WI Bemidji MN and Duluth MN Kurt is currently a minority stock holder with transition plans and buy sell agreements already in place Throughout the unleaded tank boom of the late sixties the mechanical computer pricing upgrades and the gas station self service boom of the late seventies all the way to the age of electronic retrofits to gas pumps the development of the multiple product dispenser MPD and then the business boom of underground tank compliance in the nineties and moving into the new regulations of credit card processing such as EMV European Master Visa mobile payments and Chip and PIN Technology Pump Meter Service has always kept its focus on what s best for its customers and operated accordingly This has been one key to their success and will continue to be in the future as they move into the uncharted waters of renewable and cleaner fueling
