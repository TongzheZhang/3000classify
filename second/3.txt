1	pump meter service petroleum equipment and commercial fueling solutions pump meter service has been selling and installing petroleum products since the ''s if you have a question about fueling station pump meter service inc history goes back to when a south minneapolis minnesota mechanic named cliff price began servicing and repairing gas pumps for the local service station market his petroleum fueling service business slowly grew through the great depression and as time went on he added several employees howard abel from buffalo minnesota was one of the hired employees and is significant because he remained a full time employee of pump meter service until when he retired after retiring he worked part time until his death in abel was just one example of the rich history of great people pump meter service has employed over its year history of petroleum fueling service cofounders cliff price lee radermacher cliff price the founder sold out to ken wanner in and the petroleum service company was renamed price wanner inc cliff stayed on as a mentor for the new manager lee radermacher until ken wanner sold the company to form a group of investors this group went on to become arrow tank company which still exists today in cambridge minnesota cliff price and lee radermacher reacquired complete ownership and renamed the company pump meter service inc in at this time pump meter service was located at east franklin in south minneapolis cliff continued to serve as a partner and mentor to lee as time went on the young and eager lee radermacher began taking on more responsibilities and assumed more of an active role in pump meter service s direction at the time pump meter service was largely a petroleum service company for several major oil companies they also provided petroleum services to other companies in the twin cities such as northwest service station equipment and oil equipment both these companies sold equipment and hired pump meter service to do the equipment installations by lee had complete ownership and began a growth process with steady increases in sales year by year sadly cliff price passed away that same year however his tradition of a small family business with quality people was well implanted into lee s business strategy after years with such an experienced partner in the petroleum service industry in the early years all gas pump lines were serviced and parts were obtained either directly from the factory or from the local distributor pump meter service was a bowser pump distributor in the fifties and early sixties which at the time was a substantial gas pump manufacturer owned by keene corp in gilbert and barker inc later gilbarco approached pump meter service about becoming a gilbarco distributor gilbarco was a strong pump line in the east and south but bowser was floundering gilbarco had an almost non existent market share in minnesota pump meter service took on the gilbarco line and in conjunction with new and innovative products from gilbarco proceeded to become the number one petroleum pump line in the twin cities this was accomplished not only because of a great product but more importantly by a strong service support network and the assurances from pump meter service to back up its petroleum service products this fact is slowly being lost in today's world of incremental market share and big box sellers as time went on other excellent petroleum equipment lines were added such as graco rotary lift veeder root red jacket lsi containment solutions xerxes opw and franklin fueling to name a few pump meter service kept adding quality employees who remain to this day the cornerstone of its success in and lee's sons joe radermacher and tom radermacher joined the family business bringing engineering and professional talents to the firm which allowed lee to reduce his time commitment several key employees were on board at that time namely ron komis and stan biggen several more would follow in the ensuing years mike eicher art staaf cheryl simpson don krushke ron smith sparky bejin and numerous others too lengthy to list here pump meter service is very proud of their employees a big change from the five employees they started with in in pump meter service was relocated to its present location in hopkins minnesota woodrich construction sold out allowing pump meter service to expand on acres in a square foot warehouse and service building was added to the existing sqare foot bldg in a buyout agreement was written between lee and his two sons and was finalized in lee after great years retired and now spends the winters at his arizona home and summers in minnesota now a third generation is taking the reins at pump and meter service inc kurt radermacher joe's son has taken an active role in sales management a graduate of purdue university with a degree in business kurt brings fresh new energy to sales and marketing he is assembling a new young team in sales service and construction and expanding branch operations in chippewa falls wi bemidji mn and duluth mn kurt is currently a minority stock holder with transition plans and buy sell agreements already in place throughout the unleaded tank boom of the late sixties the mechanical computer pricing upgrades and the gas station self service boom of the late seventies all the way to the age of electronic retrofits to gas pumps the development of the multiple product dispenser mpd and then the business boom of underground tank compliance in the nineties and moving into the new regulations of credit card processing such as emv european master visa mobile payments and chip and pin technology pump meter service has always kept its focus on what s best for its customers and operated accordingly this has been one key to their success and will continue to be in the future as they move into the uncharted waters of renewable and cleaner fueling options

0	 dolphin products has evolved over the years from t b exotic fish a chain of aquarium shops named for tom barbara briscall as we grew we started looking to filtration needs of aquariums and ponds what we saw was a lack of reliable pumps and fish friendly and human friendly chemicals and additives we looked to the water purification industry and with the help of a microbiology lab developed a line of truly effective products which promote a very healthy environment for both pond and aquarium fishes these products have also become very important in commercial applications protecting systems from the harmful effects of ammonia during the periods of population fluctuations thus was born the dolphin pharmaceuticals division of dolphin aquarium pet products during the seventies we noticed that the pumps that we were marketing were inefficient and had relatively short life spans in addition the high noise levels heat transfer and low volume turnover of magnetic drive pumps adde to the overall cost of ownership high speed direct drive pumps had their place and also had the higher noise levels and heat issues in reviewing the needs of the industry we threw out the current thinking and developed a new type of pump which would move high volumes of water while consuming low amounts of current in the late s the dolphin pumps division developed the unique approach of utilizing low rpm motors with wide high horsepower impellers this created the first quiet cool running high volume aquarium and pond pump over the years we have continued the development of our pumps and continue to use the best materials available of course like other pumps back then there was room for improvement we did not want dolphin s brand to stagnate and we felt the to keep improving through dedicated research while other manufacturers stayed with status quo we solved any possible pump failure issues the dolphin diamond series pumps are designed to provide up to and over a decade of maintenance free service even in the most abrasive reef environment our confidence is evident in our warranty

0	 about kmt waterjet cutting systems global headquarters located in baxter springs kansas corporate office of kmt waterjet systems and is globally recognized as a leading manufacturer of waterjet systems beginning in the now decades old ever expanding building located at west th street in baxter springs kansas has seen it s share of manufacturing highs and lows built on the hard work ingenuity and sweat of its employees then mccartney manufacturing co was the very fabric of american manufacturing in post wwii era joe mccartney s dream began in blocks east in an abandoned gas station where he built equipment for the manufacturing of wooden toys the company moved to a larger facility in and evolved into making parts for the booming polyethylene business primarily supplying parts for poly gas oil compressors to the ingersoll rand company birth of the first intensifier pump waterjet cutting machine due to poor health joe sold his company in to ingersoll rand now kmt where they began experimenting with high pressure intensifiers and discovered that water under pressure could cut most anything in history was made when the very first commercial use waterjet cutting system was installed for the alton box board company a cardboard box manufacturing facility kmt waterjet cutting early intensifier pumpknown as the fluid jet cutting system it eliminated the use of commercial saws and was designed for the contour cutting of furniture packing forms for the papertube division in jackson tn since the proud employees of mccartney ldpe manufacturing ingersoll rand and today kmt waterjet have served a pivotal role as true pioneers in the manufacturing industry by developing leading designs of waterjet intensifier pumps and precision cutting heads since then thousands of companies around the world have harnessed waterjet cutting to manufacture products for use in a variety of industries since it's origin mccartney ldpe manufacturing has been on the cutting edge in the high pressure cutting industry in sweden based karolin machine tool kmt co expanded their tooling business by purchasing the poly and waterjet division from ingersoll rand the baxter springs location currently employs approximately people is the corporate office of kmt waterjet systems and is globally recognized as a leading manufacturer of waterjet systems kmt waterjets are sold worldwide with offices in brazil canada china france germany india italy korea mexico poland spain united arab emirates and the uk additionally the polyethylene division continues to thrive and grow and carries on the legacy of the mccartney name where it is known worldwide as kmt mccartney ldpe products kmt waterjet is iso certifiedkmt waterjet is a world class manufacturing facility with iso certification csa ce certified trained technicians ped approval and tssa certification the birth of waterjet and it's pioneer dr norman franz dr norman charles franz a wjta pioneer award winner invented industrial waterjet cutting in the s this invention was a spin off of a research program that dr franz was conducting on the machining waterjet cutting pioneer dr franz ingersoll rand kmt waterjetof wood the use of waterjets to cut wood was inspired by the observation that broom handles used for testing for leaks from very high pressure boiler systems were cut off by the escaping steam later investigation showed that industrial cutting with steam jets was impractical because of the high gas pressures involved however this suggested the use of waterjets dr franz experimented with a single action intensifier which developed over psi waterjets but the waterjets were discontinuous he was thereby able to cut wood and other materials with ordinary water dr franz then searched for a high pressure pump that would pump water continuously so as to produce a steady waterjet he arranged a loan from mccartney manufacturing a subsidiary of ingersoll rand now kmt waterjet systems of a high pressure intensifier pump used for catalyst injection in the manufacture of polyethylene this proved to be a reliable system for the continuous pumping of high pressure water this pump and nozzle was duplicated and integrated with a system for obtaining relative motion between the jet and the work piece such a system was installed at alton boxboard company to cut large complex parts used in the furniture industry he thus solved the problem that could not be handled by conventional cutting tools he had a unique solution to a unique production problem this jet cutting system was the first in industrial use and it operated successfully for many years it was the precursor to the multi billion dollar worldwide waterjet cutting industry we see today dr franz was also a leader in the improvement of waterjet cutting at long stand off distance by the addition of long chain polymers to the water he included an automated polymer mixing system in the alton boxboard installation and therefore he was the first to apply long chain polymer additives in commercial waterjet cutting this section about dr franz is from wjta jet news december page

was realized by advancing the standard design to include investment cast stainless steel impellers the company manufactures the only pump constructed with all lost wax investment cast technology the company s success has been built on manufacturing assembling and delivering the most dependable purpose engineered pumps in the marketplace our engineering staff has combined experience of over years today the company continues to grow in the toughest of economic conditions to meet the industry s demand for the best pump products our market segments include agricultural commercial municipal as well as specialized markets such as mine dewatering and nuclear plant cooling towers the company maintains five assembly facilities geographically positioned to service the needs of their customer base these branch locations are culver indiana marion arkansas brownfield texas and fresno california with the headquarters in fairview tennessee in order to facilitate sales and distribution to central and south america the company set up hydroflo pumps panama corporation in panama and opened an assembly plant there in the fourth quarter of this facility has an agreement with the universidad technologica de panama technological university of panama whereby students will be able to gain experience first hand assembling products under the supervision of instructors and hydroflo employees hydroflo s reputation has been based on their commitment to prompt courteous customer service and the proven reliability of stainless steel our purpose is to exemplify our motto best team wins in every aspect of our business our mission is to produce the best pump products that exceed industry standard using innovative design to fulfill our customer s expectations of quality and value our vision is to grow and prosper without compromising our core values of honesty integrity accountability and trust the regional branches allow hydroflo to take advantage of buying new and replacement parts manufactured locally and tailored for the specific needs of their respective regions the company also builds private label pumps for several system builders while the industry standard is bronze hydroflo produces a stainless steel impeller which is three times stronger additionally the company manufactures the only line of ductile iron discharge heads to go with the pump assemblies providing greater strength and more corrosion resistance fresh water is the primary resource pumped by hydroflo s products but the company also builds pumps for salt water oil butane propane and mild corrosive chemicals investment casting is commonly referred to as lost wax processing it is a method of casting in which a wax form is encased in a heat resistant ceramic material the cast is then heated to melt and drain away the wax producing a mold for molten metal to be poured lost wax processing allows a wider range of materials to be used including all stainless alloys the process permits more intricate designs than other processes can produce due to the complexity of their form and shape and does so with lighter weights and thinner walls for hydroflo lost wax processing provides a pump impeller with a far smoother surface than traditional sand casting sand casting usually leaves a corrosive residue and abrasive surface even under the most careful applications pumps have constantly moving parts so it is easy to visualize how the finer finish increases the life and performance of the pumps and related parts organization an uncompromising commitment to quality integrity and service continues to drive the prosperity of hydroflo amassing an engineering staff with over years combined pump experience as well as tapping the diverse talents of their key executives managers and employees the company is experiencing double digit growth despite the challenging economic conditions hydroflo is positioned to reach their sales projections for they have successfully served their

of similar capabilities during the s and the name of the company was changed to loren specialty manufacturing company inc with the start of the new decade became a time when all domestic production was stopped and loren specialty was under government contract making materials for wwii e s machine gun synchronizer which timed the firing of a machine gun bullets between the spinning propeller blades on aircraft was one of the company s projects the government had design problems with the e s though because as the gears wore down the timing would change causing the pilot to shoot off his own propeller loren specialty also manufactured the caliber machine gun recoil mechanisms when aircraft guns were wing mounted nose cones for shells booby traps and distress signals for the navy were among the other products assigned to the company company historians told stories of rumored nazi attempts to sabotage production by bombing the factory stopped just in time by u s officials while the truth of these stories is unknown it certainly is interesting to consider with the end of the war the company resumed manufacture of the presto line of products paper punches staplers staple removers

how we can help you noteworth industry news the wastewater industry has seen tough times in recent years with a combination of low flow urinals and toilets in combination with flushable items this is the latest in examples of how this impacts our municipal systems from abc news picture flushability of wipes spawns class action lawsuit march by u jin lee flushable wipes have caused problems in new york city wastewater treatment plants nyc environmental protection a new york doctor has filed a federal class action lawsuit against the makers of flushable wipes after experiencing what he claims were major plumbing and clogging issues in his home the defendants should have known that their representations regarding flushable wipes were false and misleading the complaint states the lawsuit by dr joseph kurtz who lives in brooklyn n y cites kimberly clark and costco wholesale corporations and seeks damages of at least million the suit filed on feb in the eastern district of new york represents people and claims that consumers around the country have suffered through clogged pipes flooding jammed sewers and problems with septic tanks due to the use of flushable wipes the lawsuit is the latest complaint against the flushable wipes in recent years over the past five to six years new york city's department of environmental protection has spent over million to have these wipes removed by hand from the sewer system according to deputy commissioner vincent sapienza when the department looked at the sales of flushable wipes sapienza said that there was almost a direct correlation between an increase in product sales and an increase in clogs within its sewage treatment facilities the word flushable means it won t clog your toilet or your house but when it gets to a sewage treatment plant the wipes wrap around the equipment shuts it down and then the treatment plant workers go and manually pull these wipes out sapienza told abc news on monday the agency recommends that people not flush these wipes and instead throw them out in the garbage can the wipes market is a billion a year industry with sales growing by to percent annually according to court papers in response to this federal lawsuit bob brand a spokesperson for kimberly clark the makers of cottonelle wipes said kimberly clark has an extensive testing process to ensure that our flushable wipes products meet or exceed all industry guidelines and we stand behind our claims of flushability a costco official told abc news that costco does not comment on lawsuits while the cleansing cloth packages are labeled as flushable and sewer and septic safe the lawsuit states that there are no legal requirements that a product must meet in order to claim that it is flushable and only voluntary guidelines may be followed at the discretion of manufacturers experts running public wastewater facilities have independently tested the wipes because there is no legal standard we started doing testing ourselves because we couldn t get any information from the manufacturers said rob villee executive director of the plainfield area regional sewerage authority in new jersey villee who has been working on the testing of these wipes for four years said that when the wipes were put in liters of water the cottonelle wipes took minutes to disperse while the costco wipes even after three hours were not totally broken up and there was no noticeable loss of mass unlike the cottonelle brand that uses a water soluble binder that breaks down when put in water the costco brand has a plastic backing sheet on the wipes villee said i flushed that sucker down times and it still held together he said the water environment federation and the american public works association both nonprofit groups that deal with wastewater issues are expected to meet later this year with product manufacturers to jointly determine what the term flushable should mean villee said the groups also expected to do more testing on the wipes he said

drainage and sewage borehole booster sets and variable speed as we are direct distributors an out of hour s technical advice line is also available aquada uv sterilisers we supply and fit uv lamps to control bacteria mainly in spring and borehole water they come in a range of sizes from small domestic to large industrial a uv lamp is of great importance when water which is to be used for human consumption does not come direct from the water undertakers main supply i e it comes from a spring or a borehole normally a small particle filter will be fitted before the lamp this reduces sediment in the water so the uv rays can penetrate the water to be treated the light then neutralises the bugs and bacteria this is vital because you can t always assume because your water comes from a freshwater spring or bore hole that it is of drinking quality if you own or manage a commercial premises you will usually receive a visit from the local council or environment agency who will take water samples and inform you of the water quality and if it is safe to drink or you may have a private residential home and be cautious of the water supply or even be buying bottled water for drinking and cooking can you really afford to take the risk of poor water quality with your business or home uv sterilizers are easy to fit and as borehole water and spring water is usually free comparatively cheep to buy private water supplies are covered by the private water supply regulations we can assist you with compliance with this code water softeners we supply install and service commercial and domestic softeners to suit all applications simplex duplex time clock and meter controlled softeners water softeners work by a process known as iron exchange the hard water passes through a high quality cation exchange resin column inside a pressure vessel the resin removes the positively charged calcium and magnesium ions from solution and exchanges them for ions of sodium when the sodium irons have been exchanged for calcium or magnesium the resin must be regenerated by recharging it using sodium irons this is a flushing method using salt solution brine this program can be set to happen as and when required alternatively a meter controlled head can be fitted to ensure regeneration takes place as and when required we also carry out all aspects of service and repair of siata fleck autotrol and clack valves resin bed cleaning disinfection including new resin beds if required on site testing for soft water supply of pre packaged salt water rams a little known fact regarding water rams is that they use downhill pressure to pump water much higher than it originally started with no other power needed a ft fall is enough to push water up ft above the source these pumps are ideal for rural sites both domestic and commercial although water rams have been around for hundreds of years and their main design has changed very little they are highly effective and are ideal for environmental use it is a misconception that ram pumps are noisy this is true some are but we can now supply and fit high lifter ram pumps which are considerably quieter it has to be said with these type of pumps the water needs to be cleaner and grit free than for a normal ram if the ram pump you are currently using is faulty we are able to recondition and service it we even make parts for some of the older obsolete pumps in our own workshops hydraguard is currently a stockist for blake s and hydram water rams high purity water plant this is either provided by a series of vessels and chemicals or now more commonly via reverse osmosis this is done by filtering the water to be treated through a series of membranes the size of the membrane depends entirely on he clients requirements of water quality this process also reduces the requirement for the use of chemicals to treat water making it more environmentally friendly in many cases after water has passed through a reverse osmosis plant it can either be discharged down a sewer or used in other processes this obviously reduces operating costs by using recycled not raw water reverse osmosis plants are usually specified with pre treatment forms or process such as softening the water to prevent the membranes scaling up cartridge filters to remove small particles and carbon filtration to remove chlorine all reverse osmosis plants are manufactured to provide a dedicated function for the client and come in various forms of packages and sizes a full range of support and service can also be provided filtration designed for specific requirements of domestic or process work cartridge sand or backwashable resin bed systems from a simple cartridge filter to a large bespoke system capable of several thousand

1	 integrated pump technology appointed exclusive distributor for grindex in southern africa september admin integrated pump technology has been appointed as the exclusive distributor in southern africa for grindex the world s third largest submersible pump manufacturer with effect from july located in bartlett boksburg ipt is a pump focused business delivering an improved all round service to its customers it will assume responsibility for the development of the grindex business in a number of high potential african countries integrated pump technology already has the expertise infrastructure and capabilities to service long standing grindex customers while growing its pump installation base further graham russell executive chairman says grindex has had a presence in south africa since the late s most recently through voith turbo our first job since acquiring the agency is to assure the market that it is business as usual we guarantee relationship product service and price structure continuity integrated pump technology is delighted to continue the long association with grindex in south africa where it is a household name and we look forward to the challenge of growing the brand in africa russell says russell and his integrated pump technology team consisting of sales service and administration personnel understand the grindex product range fully the team is fully committed to building on the grindex success story in africa he says located in a new industrial business park close to or tambo international airport integrated pump technology boasts a newly built m warehouse and offices the grindex certified warehouse holds a comprehensive stock inventory acquired from voith as well as encompassing a full service repair and kw test tank facility we have an established distribution network of strategically located and specialised pump companies and key account managers whose proximity to our end users provide a fast personal service the warehouse supports the distribution structure in terms of sales repairs and rentals to botswana namibia zambia the democratic republic of congo drc mozambique and zimbabwe integrated pump technology will use its new facility to develop its rental model a new development for grindex in this market we see the rental business as a big opportunity and are building a significant rental stockholding to service this sector russell says he explains that integrated pump technology s strategy furthermore is to develop broader product lines and niche non competing premium brands it will also grow the grindex footprint in a range of industries from mining to construction in keeping with its market segmentation internationally the south african and sub saharan african markets were the largest export markets for grindex in and and the second largest in this year is already looking exceptionally good for us driven largely by our exports to zambia and the drc there is a full service and test facility in zambia we are hoping to regain our number one position this year and look on track to do so russell says recent flagship contracts include the supply of highly wear resistant bravo submersible slurry pumps to the drc and a further submersible mega n pumps to zambia in south africa grindex has enjoyed a number of successful demonstration test trials in pond dewatering applications in rustenburg and richards bay research and development takes place at the grindex head office in sweden from where new generation pumps are introduced to the market regularly in order to keep up to date with new product lines and innovations integrated pump technology will provide distributor and employee training once a year we will also take our distributors and staff to the grindex factory in sweden where they will have access to further training a grindex representative based in south africa will provide seamless interaction and communication with sweden says russell the main innovations of the grindex dewatering products are the capability of the sub kw range to run dry this is due to a unique air valve integrated into the pump which allows the impeller to pass air instead of water past the motor in a dry run condition the patented smart motor protector ensures thermal overload phase loss and phase rotation protection the protector and all associated electrical switchgear are installed inside the pump itself meaning there is no need for a control panel with the added benefit of being able to run the pump without supervision the grindex sludge range has all the advantages of the dewatering range coupled with a recessed vortex impeller and a split hydraulic with replaceable polyurethane linings this makes the sludge units capable of greater solids handling with increased abrasion resistance the lightweight aluminium construction means that these highly portable and robust pumps are ideal for underground face dewatering the dewatering and sludge pumps are also available in cast stainless steel with a capacity of handling ph values between and which means they are ideal for process applications grindex also manufactures a range of pedigree slurry pumps boasting a total hard chrome construction of the wet end these units are designed to move medium to heavy slurries with high abrasive content without sacrificing efficiency abrasion resistance or production downtime

0	 power equipment direct was first conceived by jon hoch the company's founder after an awful experience shopping for a lawnmower in hoch wasted an entire saturday and in gas driving between a half dozen big box superstores and local hardware stores trying to purchase the perfect lawnmower big bust the big box stores had a huge selection of lawnmowers collecting dust in a mammoth warehouse after hiking nearly a mile to find the right aisle hoch finally found the lawnmowers hoisted two stories in the air he tried to round up a sales person to help bring one down so he could read the information on the box the first two ran and hid the third one didn't have a clue he then tried deciphering what remained of the tattered marketing materials which was nearly impossible without being trampled on by the other customers peaceful overpriced frustrated he climbed back into his tiny saturn and drove across town to the local hardware store to find some solitude that's about all he found premiere hardware store carried a handful of lawnmowers but the model that he wanted was overpriced and sold out great he finally found the product he wanted albeit for too much but he couldn't even buy it so he drove to the same store in the next town to purchase it apparently everyone else in the area had the same idea the store just sold the last one an hour earlier even if the store had the merchandise hoch realized that he probably couldn't fit the huge box into his little sedan without scratching half the paint off the door frame exhausted from shopping hoch special ordered an overpriced lawnmower paid an enormous amount sales tax and a huge service charge to have it shipped to his house he realized that there's got to be a better way the birth of a new company power equipment direct was founded on the premise of simplified shopping customers could sort through all of the leading power equipment products online from the comfort of their homes no traffic jams no crowds no scratched tailgates plus all of the equipment including hard to find accessories would ship directly from the factory to the customer's door eliminating the need for stores warehouses and clueless clerks power equipment direct streamlined the sales process and rewarded customers with factory direct discounts and a sales tax free guarantee on its vast selection of products hoch launched his first web store pressurewashersdirect com from his basement in the goal to sell one pressure washer a week in order to make a car payment several years and a couple of web stores later power equipment direct is one of the leading online power equipment e tailers with millions of dollars in annual sales the company owns more than a dozen power equipment related web addresses and plans to open more specialty superstores in the very near future

0	 why simple pump for right now to protect your family against grid equipment failures hurricanes tornadoes floods forest fires ice snow and wind storms for possible future problems political unrest emps worsening climate attack and more in thinking about purchasing the simple pump there are two main questions why buy any backup pump at all then if buying a hand pump why buy a simple pump rather than one of the competition why buy any hand pump at all there are many current circumstances that make having a hand pump a very good idea we have had customers tell us about getting through the aftermath of ice storms snow storms tornados hurricanes floods and forest fires with their simple pump living rurally it s not a matter of if the power goes out it s when and for how long just the last decade has seen people over wide areas being without power for weeks and even as much as months and of course there are more serious possible reasons to think about in the future political economic climactic grid and astronomical circumstances that could seriously interfere with our lives and wellbeing buying a manual pump is like insurance except instead of having to pay again every year it s a one time payment and the insurance is for something far more important than our car or our house why buy a simple pump rather than one of the competition because it's by far the most capable hand pump on the market at a price no other serious pump can match gives you full normal use of all your home's taps and plumbing fixtures even from deep wells simple pump pumps into pressure the pressurized water tank of your home's plumbing system and gives you full use of all your household plumbing year round in any climate much easier to pump some of our clients have replaced working pumps of other kinds because the simple pump is so much easier to use remember slamming older car doors compared to the gentle pull needed for a modern door that's the difference that computer controlled machining and modern materials make and simple pump is the only hand pump made with computer controlled machining read one client's story can pump from much further down our low effort pumping also means we can pump from further down far beyond the reach of any other hand pump as far as feet water level fits in the majority of wells alongside the submersible needs only or clearance in summary the alternatives amount to either cheaper pumps with much less capability or other serious pumps with similar output and support beyond feet but which are considerably more expensive than the simple pump and require enormously greater pumping effort the simple pump is by far the most capable hand pump on the market and yet it's available at a price no other serious pump can match related links client stories
