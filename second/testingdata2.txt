its customers it will assume responsibility for the development of the grindex business in a number of high potential african countries integrated pump technology already has the expertise infrastructure and capabilities to service long standing grindex customers while growing its pump installation base further graham russell executive chairman says grindex has had a presence in south africa since the late s most recently through voith turbo our first job since acquiring the agency is to assure the market that it is business as usual we guarantee relationship product service and price structure continuity integrated pump technology is delighted to continue the long association with grindex in south africa where it is a household name and we look forward to the challenge of growing the brand in africa russell says russell and his integrated pump technology team consisting of sales service and administration personnel understand the grindex product range fully the team is fully committed to building on the grindex success story in africa he says located in a new industrial business park close to or tambo international airport integrated pump technology boasts a newly built m warehouse and offices the grindex certified warehouse holds a comprehensive stock inventory acquired from voith as well as encompassing a full service repair and kw test tank facility we have an established distribution network of strategically located and specialised pump companies and key account managers whose proximity to our end users provide a fast personal service the warehouse supports the distribution structure in terms of sales repairs and rentals to botswana namibia zambia the democratic republic of congo drc mozambique and zimbabwe integrated pump technology will use its new facility to develop its rental model a new development for grindex in this market we see the rental business as a big opportunity and are building a significant rental stockholding to service this sector russell says he explains that integrated pump technology s strategy furthermore is to develop broader product lines and niche non competing premium brands it will also grow the grindex footprint in a range of industries from mining to construction in keeping with its market segmentation internationally the south african and sub saharan african markets were the largest export markets for grindex in and and the second largest in this year is already looking exceptionally good for us driven largely by our exports to zambia and the drc there is a full service and test facility in zambia we are hoping to regain our number one position this year and look on track to do so russell says recent flagship contracts include the supply of highly wear resistant bravo submersible slurry pumps to the drc and a further submersible mega n pumps to zambia in south africa grindex has enjoyed a number of successful demonstration test trials in pond dewatering applications in rustenburg and richards bay research and development takes place at the grindex head office in sweden from where new generation pumps are introduced to the market regularly in order to keep up to date with new product lines and innovations integrated pump technology will provide distributor and employee training once a year we will also take our distributors and staff to the grindex factory in sweden where they will have access to further training a grindex representative based in south africa will provide seamless interaction and communication with sweden says russell the main innovations of the grindex dewatering products are the capability of the sub kw range to run dry this is due to a unique air valve integrated into the pump which allows the impeller to pass air instead of water past the motor in a dry run condition the patented smart motor protector ensures thermal overload phase loss and phase rotation protection the protector and all associated electrical switchgear are installed inside the pump itself meaning there is no need for a control panel with the added benefit of being able to run the pump without supervision the grindex sludge range has all the advantages of the dewatering range coupled with a recessed vortex impeller and a split hydraulic with replaceable polyurethane linings this makes the sludge units capable of greater solids handling with increased abrasion resistance the lightweight aluminium construction means that these highly portable and robust pumps are ideal for underground face dewatering the dewatering and sludge pumps are also available in cast stainless steel with a capacity of handling ph values between and which means they are ideal for process applications grindex also manufactures a range of pedigree slurry pumps boasting a total hard chrome construction of the wet end these units are designed to move medium to heavy slurries with high abrasive content without sacrificing efficiency abrasion resistance or production downtime

0	pump meter service petroleum equipment and commercial fueling solutions pump meter service has been selling and installing petroleum products since the ''s if you have a question about fueling station pump meter service inc history goes back to when a south minneapolis minnesota mechanic named cliff price began servicing and repairing gas pumps for the local service station market his petroleum fueling service business slowly grew through the great depression and as time went on he added several employees howard abel from buffalo minnesota was one of the hired employees and is significant because he remained a full time employee of pump meter service until when he retired after retiring he worked part time until his death in abel was just one example of the rich history of great people pump meter service has employed over its year history of petroleum fueling service cofounders cliff price lee radermacher cliff price the founder sold out to ken wanner in and the petroleum service company was renamed price wanner inc cliff stayed on as a mentor for the new manager lee radermacher until ken wanner sold the company to form a group of investors this group went on to become arrow tank company which still exists today in cambridge minnesota cliff price and lee radermacher reacquired complete ownership and renamed the company pump meter service inc in at this time pump meter service was located at east franklin in south minneapolis cliff continued to serve as a partner and mentor to lee as time went on the young and eager lee radermacher began taking on more responsibilities and assumed more of an active role in pump meter service s direction at the time pump meter service was largely a petroleum service company for several major oil companies they also provided petroleum services to other companies in the twin cities such as northwest service station equipment and oil equipment both these companies sold equipment and hired pump meter service to do the equipment installations by lee had complete ownership and began a growth process with steady increases in sales year by year sadly cliff price passed away that same year however his tradition of a small family business with quality people was well implanted into lee s business strategy after years with such an experienced partner in the petroleum service industry in the early years all gas pump lines were serviced and parts were obtained either directly from the factory or from the local distributor pump meter service was a bowser pump distributor in the fifties and early sixties which at the time was a substantial gas pump manufacturer owned by keene corp in gilbert and barker inc later gilbarco approached pump meter service about becoming a gilbarco distributor gilbarco was a strong pump line in the east and south but bowser was floundering gilbarco had an almost non existent market share in minnesota pump meter service took on the gilbarco line and in conjunction with new and innovative products from gilbarco proceeded to become the number one petroleum pump line in the twin cities this was accomplished not only because of a great product but more importantly by a strong service support network and the assurances from pump meter service to back up its petroleum service products this fact is slowly being lost in today's world of incremental market share and big box sellers as time went on other excellent petroleum equipment lines were added such as graco rotary lift veeder root red jacket lsi containment solutions xerxes opw and franklin fueling to name a few pump meter service kept adding quality employees who remain to this day the cornerstone of its success in and lee's sons joe radermacher and tom radermacher joined the family business bringing engineering and professional talents to the firm which allowed lee to reduce his time commitment several key employees were on board at that time namely ron komis and stan biggen several more would follow in the ensuing years mike eicher art staaf cheryl simpson don krushke ron smith sparky bejin and numerous others too lengthy to list here pump meter service is very proud of their employees a big change from the five employees they started with in in pump meter service was relocated to its present location in hopkins minnesota woodrich construction sold out allowing pump meter service to expand on acres in a square foot warehouse and service building was added to the existing sqare foot bldg in a buyout agreement was written between lee and his two sons and was finalized in lee after great years retired and now spends the winters at his arizona home and summers in minnesota now a third generation is taking the reins at pump and meter service inc kurt radermacher joe's son has taken an active role in sales management a graduate of purdue university with a degree in business kurt brings fresh new energy to sales and marketing he is assembling a new young team in sales service and construction and expanding branch operations in chippewa falls wi bemidji mn and duluth mn kurt is currently a minority stock holder with transition plans and buy sell agreements already in place throughout the unleaded tank boom of the late sixties the mechanical computer pricing upgrades and the gas station self service boom of the late seventies all the way to the age of electronic retrofits to gas pumps the development of the multiple product dispenser mpd and then the business boom of underground tank compliance in the nineties and moving into the new regulations of credit card processing such as emv european master visa mobile payments and chip and pin technology pump meter service has always kept its focus on what s best for its customers and operated accordingly this
