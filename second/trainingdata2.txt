hydroflo produces a stainless steel impeller which is three times stronger additionally the company manufactures the only line of ductile iron discharge heads to go with the pump assemblies providing greater strength and more corrosion resistance fresh water is the primary resource pumped by hydroflo s products but the company also builds pumps for salt water oil butane propane and mild corrosive chemicals investment casting is commonly referred to as lost wax processing it is a method of casting in which a wax form is encased in a heat resistant ceramic material the cast is then heated to melt and drain away the wax producing a mold for molten metal to be poured lost wax processing allows a wider range of materials to be used including all stainless alloys the process permits more intricate designs than other processes can produce due to the complexity of their form and shape and does so with lighter weights and thinner walls for hydroflo lost wax processing provides a pump impeller with a far smoother surface than traditional sand casting sand casting usually leaves a corrosive residue and abrasive surface even under the most careful applications pumps have constantly moving parts so it is easy to visualize how the finer finish increases the life and performance of the pumps and related parts organization an uncompromising commitment to quality integrity and

with customized systems and service and ancillary products and equipment a brief overview of the history of semler industries inc and its distinct competencies has been provided so that you begin to understand the unique capabilities semler offers the company evolved from a four story building located at the corner of kedzie and carroll avenues in chicago it was built during the time of the first world war by a firm called metal specialties manufacturing company this firm was first incorporated in and manufactured harness hardware for horse and buggy actually buggy whip holders at one point during the early days metal specialties owned and operated a concession at what is now known as wrigley field depositing a nickel into the appropriate slot allowed a spectator to sit comfortably on a seat and enjoy the ball game during wwi the company was heavily involved in the manufacture of war materials particularly shell casings after the war they began to manufacture a wide variety of metal products as well as gummed sealing tape this was the latest in ad print allowing the store owner to actually advertise his establishment on the printed tape these were the days when a scoop of sugar coffee or flour was put into a brown bag weighed and the top then sealed with a piece of water soluble gummed tape in the late s the company manufactured paint spray guns a small vacuum cleaner and some products for automobiles there was an emphasis on flashy marketed automotive products like lena mix gas saver and glow bob gas saver the company also made the first dash board mounted cigar lighter stop signal switches under the hood electric engine heaters visors engine lights head and tail lamps and sockets these were sold to automakers like buick chevrolet chrysler dodge ford and oldsmobile and for some cars long out of production like the auburn hudson nash stutz willys knight and the ever popular wolverine loren h semler sr went to work for metal specialties in when their speedo byke hit the market they also developed roller skates with rubber wheels manufactured aluminum frying pans vacuum cleaners and food dehydrators and aluminum snow shovels and sleds in at the height of the depression loren h semler sr purchased metal specialties manufacturing company and it was in under his guidance that the company first introduced the small pocket and desk size staplers under the trademark presto the company had been losing money up to then and he turned things around with the introduction of these office products subsequently leading to a merger with another company of similar capabilities during the s and the name of the company was changed to loren specialty manufacturing company inc with the start of the new decade became a time when all domestic production was stopped and loren specialty was under government contract making materials for wwii e s machine gun synchronizer which timed the firing of a machine gun bullets between the spinning propeller blades on aircraft was one of the company s projects the government had design problems with the e s though because as the gears wore down the timing would change causing the pilot to shoot off his own propeller loren specialty also manufactured the caliber machine gun recoil mechanisms when aircraft guns were wing mounted nose cones for shells booby traps and distress signals for the navy were among the other products assigned to the company company historians told stories of rumored nazi attempts to sabotage production by bombing the factory stopped just in time by u s officials while the truth of these stories is unknown it certainly is interesting to consider with the end of the war the company resumed manufacture of the presto line of products paper punches staplers staple removers and card files and in meyer ekstrom was merged into loren specialty bringing new products to sell this was the forerunner of what became the first operating group called hydraulics pneumatics today semler still offer components whose roots began in this group but the operating group itself was operationally merged into today s current groups in the melrose park plant was built at cornell avenue here the company introduced the first electric eraser for pencil and ink pens in blott robb company was purchased and the presto line of products was sold blott robb was the forerunner of today s liquid handling group the company made high pressure valves and rows of punch presses and burnishing machines made metal shearstrips which used air pressure to blast coal away from the walls in mining operations a much safer alternative to dynamite in the company made the move from melrose park to our current franklin park location where our job shop manufactured dispenso pak aircraft refueling cabinets allowing the salespeople to sell a pump meter filter hose reel hose and nozzle all together finally in loren specialty formerly known as metal specialties meyer ekstrom and blott robb merged to become semler industries inc at this time new filter product lines were added to expand business and this developed into our third group fluid purification at that time loren h semler jr the eldest son of loren h semler sr became president of semler industries inc in the first potable water cabinets pwc s were designed and sold to united airlines this design was enhanced in the late s and semler built and provided cabinets for the ord united airlines terminal expansion since then the semler potable water cabinet has been the industry leader for the ground support industry providing cabinets

1	 industry overview australian pump industry the australian pump industry is significant with interests in all markets whether population or commodity driven the annual market for pumping equipment is estimated to exceed a million annually there are more than people employed directly by pump manufacturers and as many again by agents distributors and other businesses supplying product and services to the pump market whilst their sales represent a large dollar value the relatively small size of the australian market in world terms has resulted in businesses becoming very sophisticated and efficient in their operations this has resulted in innovation utilising the latest technology there is a diverse range of products that are made in australia with australian made products supplying over per cent of the domestic demand for pumping equipment tariff duties on imports declined from in to in this has lead to major changes in the structure of the australian industry there has been considerable rationalisation with many local companies being acquired by international operators local manufacturers have had to become more efficient in making their products and have sought markets offshore with considerable success the australian market has also benefited from the emergence of many new businesses representing the ever increasing range of pump product becoming available from overseas source

drainage and sewage borehole booster sets and variable speed as we are direct distributors an out of hour s technical advice line is also available aquada uv sterilisers we supply and fit uv lamps to control bacteria mainly in spring and borehole water they come in a range of sizes from small domestic to large industrial a uv lamp is of great importance when water which is to be used for human consumption does not come direct from the water undertakers main supply i e it comes from a spring or a borehole normally a small particle filter will be fitted before the lamp this reduces sediment in the water so the uv rays can penetrate the water to be treated the light then neutralises the bugs and bacteria this is vital because you can t always assume because your water comes from a freshwater spring or bore hole that it is of drinking quality if you own or manage a commercial premises you will usually receive a visit from the local council or environment agency who will take water samples and inform you of the water quality and if it is safe to drink or you may have a private residential home and be cautious of the water supply or even be buying bottled water for drinking and cooking can you really afford to take the risk of poor water quality with your business or home uv sterilizers are easy to fit and as borehole water and spring water is usually free comparatively cheep to buy private water supplies are covered by the private water supply regulations we can assist you with compliance with this code water softeners we supply install and service commercial and domestic softeners to suit all applications simplex duplex time clock and meter controlled softeners water softeners work by a process known as iron exchange the hard water passes through a high quality cation exchange resin column inside a pressure vessel the resin removes the positively charged calcium and magnesium ions from solution and exchanges them for ions of sodium when the sodium irons have been exchanged for calcium or magnesium the resin must be regenerated by recharging it using sodium irons this is a flushing method using salt solution brine this program can be set to happen as and when required alternatively a meter controlled head can be fitted to ensure regeneration takes place as and when required we also carry out all aspects of service and repair of siata fleck autotrol and clack valves resin bed cleaning disinfection including new resin beds if required on site testing for soft water supply of pre packaged salt water rams a little known fact regarding water rams is that they use downhill pressure to pump water much higher than it originally started with no other power needed a ft fall is enough to push water up ft above the source these pumps are ideal for rural sites both domestic and commercial although water rams have been around for hundreds of years and their main design has changed very little they are highly effective and are ideal for environmental use it is a misconception that ram pumps are noisy this is true some are but we can now supply and fit high lifter ram pumps which are considerably quieter it has to be said with these type of pumps the water needs to be cleaner and grit free than for a normal ram if the ram pump you are currently using is faulty we are able to recondition and service it we even make parts for some of the older obsolete pumps in our own workshops hydraguard is currently a stockist for blake s and hydram water rams high purity water plant this is either provided by a series of vessels and chemicals or now more commonly via reverse osmosis this is done by filtering the water to be treated through a series of membranes the size of the membrane depends entirely on he clients requirements of water quality this process also reduces the requirement for the use of chemicals to treat water making it more environmentally friendly in many cases after water has passed through a reverse osmosis plant it can either be discharged down a sewer or used in other processes this obviously reduces operating costs by using recycled not raw water reverse osmosis plants are usually specified with pre treatment forms or process such as softening the water to prevent the membranes scaling up cartridge filters to remove small particles and carbon filtration to remove chlorine all reverse osmosis plants are manufactured to provide a dedicated function for the client and come in various forms of packages and sizes a full range of support and service can also be provided filtration

0	 why simple pump for right now to protect your family against grid equipment failures hurricanes tornadoes floods forest fires ice snow and wind storms for possible future problems political unrest emps worsening climate attack and more in thinking about purchasing the simple pump there are two main questions why buy any backup pump at all then if buying a hand pump why buy a simple pump rather than one of the competition why buy any hand pump at all there are many current circumstances that make having a hand pump a very good idea we have had customers tell us about getting through the aftermath of ice storms snow storms tornados hurricanes floods and forest fires with their simple pump living rurally it s not a matter of if the power goes out it s when and for how long just the last decade has seen people over wide areas being without power for weeks and even as much as months and of course there are more serious possible reasons to think about in the future political economic climactic grid and astronomical circumstances that could seriously interfere with our lives and wellbeing buying a manual pump is like insurance except instead of having to pay again every year it s a one time payment and the insurance is for something far more important than our car or our house why buy a simple pump rather than one of the competition because it's by far the most capable hand pump on the market at a price no other serious pump can match gives you full normal use of all your home's taps and plumbing fixtures even from deep wells simple pump pumps into pressure the pressurized water tank of your home's plumbing system and gives you full use of all your household plumbing year round in any climate much easier to pump some of our clients have replaced working pumps of other kinds because the simple pump is so much easier to use remember slamming older car doors compared to the gentle pull needed for a modern door that's the difference that computer controlled machining and modern materials make and simple pump is the only hand pump made with computer controlled machining read one client's story can pump from much further down our low effort pumping also means we can pump from further down far beyond the reach of any other hand pump as far as feet water level fits in the majority of wells alongside the submersible needs only or clearance in summary the alternatives amount to either cheaper pumps with much less capability or other serious pumps with similar output and support beyond feet but which are considerably more expensive than the simple pump and require enormously greater pumping effort the simple pump is by far the most capable hand pump on the market and yet it's available at a price no other serious pump can match related links client stories

how we can help you noteworth industry news the wastewater industry has seen tough times in recent years with a combination of low flow urinals and toilets in combination with flushable items this is the latest in examples of how this impacts our municipal systems from abc news picture flushability of wipes spawns class action lawsuit march by u jin lee flushable wipes have caused problems in new york city wastewater treatment plants nyc environmental protection a new york doctor has filed a federal class action lawsuit against the makers of flushable wipes after experiencing what he claims were major plumbing and clogging issues in his home the defendants should have known that their representations regarding flushable wipes were false and misleading the complaint states the lawsuit by dr joseph kurtz who lives in brooklyn n y cites kimberly clark and costco wholesale corporations and seeks damages of at least million the suit filed on feb in the eastern district of new york represents people and claims that consumers around the country have suffered through clogged pipes flooding jammed sewers and problems with septic tanks due to the use of flushable wipes the lawsuit is the latest complaint against the flushable wipes in recent years over the past five to six years new york city's department of environmental protection has spent over million to have these wipes removed by hand from the sewer system according to deputy commissioner vincent sapienza when the department looked at the sales of flushable wipes sapienza said that there was almost a direct correlation between an increase in product sales and an increase in clogs within its sewage treatment facilities the word flushable means it won t clog your toilet or your house but when it gets to a sewage treatment plant the wipes wrap around the equipment shuts it down and then the treatment plant workers go and manually pull these wipes out sapienza told abc news on monday the agency recommends that people not flush these wipes and instead throw them out in the garbage can the wipes market is a billion a year industry with sales growing by to percent annually according to court papers in response to this federal lawsuit bob brand a spokesperson for kimberly clark the makers of cottonelle wipes said kimberly clark has an extensive testing process to ensure that our flushable wipes products meet or exceed all industry guidelines and we stand behind our claims of flushability a costco official told abc news that costco does not comment on lawsuits while the cleansing cloth packages are labeled as flushable and sewer and septic safe the lawsuit states that there are no legal requirements that a product must meet in order to claim that it is flushable and only voluntary guidelines may be followed at the discretion of manufacturers experts running public wastewater facilities have independently tested the wipes because there is no legal standard we started doing testing ourselves because we couldn t get any information from the manufacturers said rob villee executive director of the plainfield area regional sewerage authority in new jersey villee who has been working on the testing of these wipes for four years said that when the wipes were put in liters of water the cottonelle wipes took minutes to disperse while the costco wipes even after three hours were not totally broken up and there was no noticeable loss of mass unlike the cottonelle brand that uses a water soluble binder that breaks down when put in water the costco brand has a plastic backing sheet on the wipes villee said i flushed that sucker down times and it still held together he said the water environment federation and the american public works association both nonprofit groups that deal with wastewater issues are expected to meet later this year with product manufacturers to jointly determine what the term flushable should mean villee said the groups also expected to do more testing on the wipes he said

africa for grindex the world s third largest submersible pump manufacturer with effect from july located in bartlett boksburg ipt is a pump focused business delivering an improved all round service to its customers it will assume responsibility for the development of the grindex business in a number of high potential african countries integrated pump technology already has the expertise infrastructure and capabilities to service long standing grindex customers while growing its pump installation base further graham russell executive chairman says grindex has had a presence in south africa since the late s most recently through voith turbo our first job since acquiring the agency is to assure the market that it is business as usual we guarantee relationship product service and price structure continuity integrated pump technology is delighted to continue the long association with grindex in south africa where it is a household name and we look forward to the challenge of growing the brand in africa russell says russell and his integrated pump technology team consisting of sales service and administration personnel understand the grindex product range fully the team is fully committed to building on the grindex success story in africa he says located in a new industrial business park close to or tambo international airport integrated pump technology boasts a newly built m warehouse and offices the grindex certified warehouse holds a comprehensive stock inventory acquired from voith as well as encompassing a full service repair and kw test tank facility we have an established distribution network of strategically located and specialised pump companies and key account managers whose proximity to our end users provide a fast personal service the warehouse supports the distribution structure in terms of sales repairs and rentals to botswana namibia zambia the democratic republic of congo drc mozambique and zimbabwe integrated pump technology will use its new facility to develop its rental model a new development for grindex in this market we see the rental business as a big opportunity and are building a significant rental stockholding to service this sector russell says he explains that integrated pump technology s strategy furthermore is to develop broader product lines and niche non competing premium brands it will also grow the grindex footprint in a range of industries from mining to construction in keeping with its market segmentation internationally the south african and sub saharan african markets were the largest export markets for grindex in and and the second largest in this year is already looking exceptionally good for us driven largely by our exports to zambia and the drc there is a full service and test facility in zambia we are hoping to regain our number one position this year and look on track to do so russell says recent flagship contracts include the supply of highly wear resistant bravo submersible slurry pumps to the drc and a further submersible mega n pumps to zambia in south africa grindex has enjoyed a number of successful demonstration test trials in pond dewatering applications in rustenburg and richards bay research and development takes place at the grindex head office in sweden from where new generation pumps are introduced to the market regularly in order to keep up to date with new product lines and innovations integrated pump technology will provide distributor and employee training once a year we will also take our distributors and staff to the grindex factory in sweden where they will have access to further training a grindex representative based in south africa will provide seamless interaction and communication with sweden says russell the main innovations of the grindex dewatering products are the capability of the sub kw range to run dry this is due to a unique air valve integrated into the pump which allows the impeller to pass air instead of water past the motor in a dry run condition the patented smart motor protector ensures thermal overload phase loss and phase rotation protection the protector and all associated electrical switchgear are installed inside the pump itself meaning there is no need for a control panel with the added benefit of being able to run the pump without supervision the grindex sludge range has all the advantages of the dewatering range coupled with a recessed vortex impeller and a split hydraulic with replaceable polyurethane linings this makes the sludge units capable of greater solids handling with increased abrasion resistance the lightweight aluminium construction means that these highly portable and robust pumps are ideal for underground face dewatering the dewatering and sludge pumps are also available in cast stainless steel with a capacity of handling ph values between and which means they are ideal for process applications grindex also manufactures a range of pedigree slurry pumps boasting a total hard chrome construction of the wet end these units are designed to move medium to heavy slurries with high abrasive content without sacrificing efficiency abrasion resistance or production downtime

0	 about kmt waterjet cutting systems global headquarters located in baxter springs kansas corporate office of kmt waterjet systems and is globally recognized as a leading manufacturer of waterjet systems beginning in the now decades old ever expanding building located at west th street in baxter springs kansas has seen it s share of manufacturing highs and lows built on the hard work ingenuity and sweat of its employees then mccartney manufacturing co was the very fabric of american manufacturing in post wwii era joe mccartney s dream began in blocks east in an abandoned gas station where he built equipment for the manufacturing of wooden toys the company moved to a larger facility in and evolved into making parts for the booming polyethylene business primarily supplying parts for poly gas oil compressors to the ingersoll rand company birth of the first intensifier pump waterjet cutting machine due to poor health joe sold his company in to ingersoll rand now kmt where they began experimenting with high pressure intensifiers and discovered that water under pressure could cut most anything in history was made when the very first commercial use waterjet cutting system was installed for the alton box board company a cardboard box manufacturing facility kmt waterjet cutting early intensifier pumpknown as the fluid jet cutting system it eliminated the use of commercial saws and was designed for the contour cutting of furniture packing forms for the papertube division in jackson tn since the proud employees of mccartney ldpe manufacturing ingersoll rand and today kmt waterjet have served a pivotal role as true pioneers in the manufacturing industry by developing leading designs of waterjet intensifier pumps and precision cutting heads since then thousands of companies around the world have harnessed waterjet cutting to manufacture products for use in a variety of industries since it's origin mccartney ldpe manufacturing has been on the cutting edge in the high pressure cutting industry in sweden based karolin machine tool kmt co expanded their tooling business by purchasing the poly and waterjet division from ingersoll rand the baxter springs location currently employs approximately people is the corporate office of kmt waterjet systems and is globally recognized as a leading manufacturer of waterjet systems kmt waterjets are sold worldwide with offices in brazil canada china france germany india italy korea mexico poland spain united arab emirates and the uk additionally the polyethylene division continues to thrive and grow and carries on the legacy of the mccartney name where it is known worldwide as kmt mccartney ldpe products kmt waterjet is iso certifiedkmt waterjet is a world class manufacturing facility with iso certification csa ce certified trained technicians ped approval and tssa certification the birth of waterjet and it's pioneer dr norman franz dr norman charles franz a wjta pioneer award winner invented industrial waterjet cutting in the s this invention was a spin off of a research program that dr franz was conducting on the machining waterjet cutting pioneer dr franz ingersoll rand kmt waterjetof wood the use of waterjets to cut wood was inspired by the observation that broom handles used for testing for leaks from very high pressure boiler systems were cut off by the escaping steam later investigation showed that industrial cutting with steam jets was impractical because of the high gas pressures involved however this suggested the use of waterjets dr franz experimented with a single action intensifier which developed over psi waterjets but the waterjets were discontinuous he was thereby able to cut wood and other materials with ordinary water dr franz then searched for a high pressure pump that would pump water continuously so as to produce a steady waterjet he arranged a loan from mccartney manufacturing a subsidiary of ingersoll rand now kmt waterjet systems of a high pressure intensifier pump used for catalyst injection in the manufacture of polyethylene this proved to be a reliable system for the continuous pumping of high pressure water this pump and nozzle was duplicated and integrated with a system for obtaining relative motion between the jet and the work piece such a system was installed at alton boxboard company to cut large complex parts used in the furniture industry he thus solved the problem that could not be handled by conventional cutting tools he had a unique solution to a unique production problem this jet cutting system was the first in industrial use and it operated successfully for many years it was the precursor to the multi billion dollar worldwide waterjet cutting industry we see today dr franz was also a leader in the improvement of waterjet cutting at long stand off distance by the addition of long chain polymers to the water he included an automated polymer mixing system in the alton boxboard installation and therefore he was the first to apply long chain polymer additives in commercial waterjet cutting this section about dr franz is from wjta jet news december page
