2	 HE PHOENIX PUMPS STORY With a presence in Arizona Western Texas California New Mexico Southern Nevada and Northern Mexico Phoenix Pumps Inc has grown to become a full service full stocking industrial distributor with its primary customers coming from the mining power generation commercial chemical food and beverage and municipal water and wastewater markets The company was founded by retired Lt Col Don Vise in the mid s The Phoenix Pumps story begins in Don Vise was flying for the U S Air Force Reserve at the time While attempting to begin a career search to become a commercial airline pilot Don decided to complete a job application for a pump manufacturing company in California Wilden Pumps Don would eventually meet the owner Jim Wilden and be offered the Assistant Sales Manager position in the company With limited knowledge about pumps Don would often spend time on the manufacturing floor learning how pumps were built as well as how the pumps operated Over the next eight years Don had developed a strong understanding of many types of pumps and related components which helped him develop a very successful career selling such items Don was also able to develop a strong and personable relationship with Jim Wilden In Don had come to the realization that his sales position carried with it very demanding travel schedules taking away from Don s time with his two young sons Brandon and Jason With Jim s blessing and encouragement he advised Don to start his own distributorship This would allow Don more flexibility and enable Don to keep his longtime relationship with Wilden Pumps With that in mind Don came to Phoenix to build his business in an area that did not have a strong pump manufacturing or distributing industry Starting in a square foot space and a loan Don got to work Don would often start at a m and work a hour day He would make his calls to vendors and customers at the beginning of the day noting that customers seemed to relate to the fact that he started work as early as they did In the early years Don concentrated on making sales calls to all of the small shops and businesses that he knew of or came across in the business community By interacting with individuals such as shop repairs and maintenance managers Don saw an opportunity to assist people in getting their jobs done easier and more efficiently Today Phoenix Pumps still carries on many of the relationships that Don had built early on It was these types of relationships as well as Don s vision and hard work that has enabled Phoenix Pumps Inc to successfully grow Today Phoenix Pumps Inc operates out of their Phoenix Arizona based headquarters The management team consists of Don s sons Brandon Vise President CEO and Jason Vise Vice President Although Don has since passed away his vision of hard work and dedication for vendors and customers lives on through his sons Phoenix Pumps Inc is customer driven and dedicated to providing solutions for the pump industry The company currently employs committed and steadfast experienced professionals that take pride in what they do The same relationship building ideals that Don believed in and utilized with his vendors and customers were the same ideals that he looked for in his team As a result of Don s belief in building relationships and trying to help others succeed Phoenix Pumps has become the successful company that it is today
