1	 ABOUT US Since Dickow Pump Company Inc has been the NAFTA trading area distributor of Dickow Pumpen KG a family owned German pump company that began manufacturing pumps in Dickow pumps are working steadily and dependably in all corners of the globe As the technical world leader in magnetic drive pumps Dickow holds many patents is ISO certified and is a supplier partner of major chemical companies worldwide Dickow Pump specializes in supplying sealless metallic centrifugal multi stage centrifugal and side channel pumps with a magnetic coupling These are available in ANSI DIN and fully conform to API standards for sealless centrifugal pumps for petroleum heavy duty chemical and gas industry applications Conventionally sealed centrifugal multi stage centrifugal side channel and API pumps are also available in DIN and fully conform to many of the API plans All units are carefully sized and built to the customer's particular fluid hydraulic requirements and condition point Dickow pumps are not mass produced but rather are manufactured to the highest standards for very specific chemical environments and applications Our Marietta GA location stocks some commonly used pump types and sizes and an extensive array of replacement parts Our repair facility is able to repair or rebuild any Dickow Pump THE DICKOW ADVANTAGE DICKOW'S MAGNETIC COUPLING The main advantage of the magnetic coupling is that the liquid pumped is hermetically sealed from the atmosphere The driving power of the motor is transferred from the outer magnets through the containment shell to the inner magnet which is connected via a shaft to the impeller The inner and outer magnets are synchronously connected meaning the pump speed is equal to the motor speed Dickow's standard containment shell is made from Hastelloy which reduces eddy currents Pumps can also be supplied with ceramic shells as well as with shells constructed of titanium and peek materials which create no eddy currents We also offer two segmented containment shells for the largest magnetic couplings available Dickow continually tests different materials and pump configurations as we are always seeking ways to improve our products and meet new challenges WEAR RESISTANT SIC SLIDE BEARINGS Dickow uses Silicon Carbide SIC as a slide bearing material due to its very high hardness and excellent corrosion and wear resistance This material allows applications in all kinds of liquids such as solvents acids hydroxides and more The sleeve type SIC bearings located in the fluid require no lubrication only a stable fluid film between the surfaces similar to the situation between seal faces COOLING OF THE MAGNETIC COUPLING AND HYDRAULICALLY BALANCED THRUST LOADS All magnetically coupled centrifugal pumps require the heat associated from the eddy currents to be dissipated The Dickow design takes fluid from the pump discharge and circulates it back to the magnets where a rear impeller increases the pressure and through some channels in the bearing housing returns it to the discharge This arrangement does not have any effect on the suction conditions Thrust can be a major concern with all mag drive pumps since the pump shaft is not connected to the motor Dickow addresses this issue with a unique pump design where the rear impeller pushes opposite of the pump impeller thus hydraulically balancing the thrust load This in turn provides for no wear of the SIC start up rings or the slide bearings STANDARD MATERIALS Standard materials for casings and wetted parts include Cast Iron Ductile Iron Carbon Steel Stainless Steel and Hastelloy C Optional materials include Duplex Stainless Steel Alloy and others on request Count on Dickow Pumps for quality reliability and longevity in service for your toughest chemical processing environments because performance is everything

2	 HE PHOENIX PUMPS STORY With a presence in Arizona Western Texas California New Mexico Southern Nevada and Northern Mexico Phoenix Pumps Inc has grown to become a full service full stocking industrial distributor with its primary customers coming from the mining power generation commercial chemical food and beverage and municipal water and wastewater markets The company was founded by retired Lt Col Don Vise in the mid s The Phoenix Pumps story begins in Don Vise was flying for the U S Air Force Reserve at the time While attempting to begin a career search to become a commercial airline pilot Don decided to complete a job application for a pump manufacturing company in California Wilden Pumps Don would eventually meet the owner Jim Wilden and be offered the Assistant Sales Manager position in the company With limited knowledge about pumps Don would often spend time on the manufacturing floor learning how pumps were built as well as how the pumps operated Over the next eight years Don had developed a strong understanding of many types of pumps and related components which helped him develop a very successful career selling such items Don was also able to develop a strong and personable relationship with Jim Wilden In Don had come to the realization that his sales position carried with it very demanding travel schedules taking away from Don s time with his two young sons Brandon and Jason With Jim s blessing and encouragement he advised Don to start his own distributorship This would allow Don more flexibility and enable Don to keep his longtime relationship with Wilden Pumps With that in mind Don came to Phoenix to build his business in an area that did not have a strong pump manufacturing or distributing industry Starting in a square foot space and a loan Don got to work Don would often start at a m and work a hour day He would make his calls to vendors and customers at the beginning of the day noting that customers seemed to relate to the fact that he started work as early as they did In the early years Don concentrated on making sales calls to all of the small shops and businesses that he knew of or came across in the business community By interacting with individuals such as shop repairs and maintenance managers Don saw an opportunity to assist people in getting their jobs done easier and more efficiently Today Phoenix Pumps still carries on many of the relationships that Don had built early on It was these types of relationships as well as Don s vision and hard work that has enabled Phoenix Pumps Inc to successfully grow Today Phoenix Pumps Inc operates out of their Phoenix Arizona based headquarters The management team consists of Don s sons Brandon Vise President CEO and Jason Vise Vice President Although Don has since passed away his vision of hard work and dedication for vendors and customers lives on through his sons Phoenix Pumps Inc is customer driven and dedicated to providing solutions for the pump industry The company currently employs committed and steadfast experienced professionals that take pride in what they do The same relationship building ideals that Don believed in and utilized with his vendors and customers were the same ideals that he looked for in his team As a result of Don s belief in building relationships and trying to help others succeed Phoenix Pumps has become the successful company that it is today
