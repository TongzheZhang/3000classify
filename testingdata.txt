1	 Dolphin Products has evolved over the years from T B Exotic Fish a chain of aquarium shops named for Tom Barbara Briscall As we grew we started looking to filtration needs of aquariums and ponds What we saw was a lack of reliable pumps and fish friendly and human friendly chemicals and additives We looked to the water purification industry and with the help of a microbiology lab developed a line of truly effective products which promote a very healthy environment for both pond and aquarium fishes These products have also become very important in commercial applications protecting systems from the harmful effects of ammonia during the periods of population fluctuations Thus was born the Dolphin Pharmaceuticals Division of Dolphin Aquarium Pet products During the seventies we noticed that the pumps that we were marketing were inefficient and had relatively short life spans In addition the high noise levels heat transfer and low volume turnover of magnetic drive pumps adde to the overall cost of ownership High speed direct drive pumps had their place and also had the higher noise levels and heat issues In reviewing the needs of the industry we threw out the current thinking and developed a new type of pump which would move high volumes of water while consuming low amounts of current In the late s The Dolphin Pumps Division developed the unique approach of utilizing low rpm motors with wide high horsepower impellers This created the first quiet cool running high volume aquarium and pond pump Over the years we have continued the development of our pumps and continue to use the best materials available Of course like other pumps back then there was room for improvement We did not want Dolphin s brand to stagnate and we felt the to keep improving Through dedicated research while other manufacturers stayed with status quo we solved any possible pump failure issues The Dolphin Diamond series pumps are designed to provide up to and over a decade of maintenance free service even in the most abrasive reef environment Our confidence is evident in our warranty

3	Pump Meter Service Petroleum Equipment and Pump Meter Service Inc history goes back to when a south Minneapolis Minnesota mechanic named Cliff Price began servicing and repairing gas pumps for the local service station market His petroleum fueling service business slowly grew through the Great Depression and as time went on he added several employees Howard Abel from Buffalo Minnesota was one of the hired employees and is significant because he remained a full time employee of Pump Meter Service until when he retired After retiring he worked part time until his death in Abel was just one example of the rich history of great people Pump Meter Service has employed over its year history of petroleum fueling service Cofounders Cliff Price Lee Radermacher Cliff Price the Founder sold out to Ken Wanner in and the petroleum service company was renamed Price Wanner Inc Cliff stayed on as a mentor for the new manager Lee Radermacher until Ken Wanner sold the company to form a group of investors This group went on to become Arrow Tank Company which still exists today in Cambridge Minnesota Cliff Price and Lee Radermacher reacquired complete ownership and renamed the company Pump Meter Service Inc in At this time Pump Meter Service was located at East Franklin in South Minneapolis Cliff continued to serve as a partner and mentor to Lee As time went on the young and eager Lee Radermacher began taking on more responsibilities and assumed more of an active role in Pump Meter Service s direction At the time Pump Meter Service was largely a petroleum service company for several major oil companies They also provided petroleum services to other companies in the Twin Cities such as Northwest Service Station Equipment and Oil Equipment Both these companies sold equipment and hired Pump Meter Service to do the equipment installations By Lee had complete ownership and began a growth process with steady increases in sales year by year Sadly Cliff Price passed away that same year However his tradition of a small family business with quality people was well implanted into Lee s business strategy after years with such an experienced partner in the petroleum service industry In the early years all gas pump lines were serviced and parts were obtained either directly from the factory or from the local distributor Pump Meter Service was a Bowser pump distributor in the fifties and early sixties which at the time was a substantial gas pump manufacturer owned by Keene Corp In Gilbert and Barker Inc later Gilbarco approached Pump Meter Service about becoming a Gilbarco distributor Gilbarco was a strong pump line in the East and South but Bowser was floundering Gilbarco had an almost non existent market share in Minnesota Pump Meter Service took on the Gilbarco line and in conjunction with new and innovative products from Gilbarco proceeded to become the number one petroleum pump line in the Twin Cities This was accomplished not only because of a great product but more importantly by a strong service support network and the assurances from Pump Meter Service to back up its petroleum service products This fact is slowly being lost in today's world of incremental market share and big box sellers As time went on other excellent petroleum equipment lines were added such as Graco Rotary Lift Veeder Root Red Jacket LSI Containment Solutions Xerxes OPW and Franklin Fueling to name a few Pump Meter Service kept adding quality employees who remain to this day the cornerstone of its success In and Lee's sons Joe Radermacher and Tom Radermacher joined the family business bringing engineering and professional talents to the firm which allowed Lee to reduce his time commitment Several key employees were on board at that time namely Ron Komis and Stan Biggen Several more would follow in the ensuing years Mike Eicher Art Staaf Cheryl Simpson Don Krushke Ron Smith Sparky Bejin and numerous others too lengthy to list here Pump Meter Service is very proud of their employees a big change from the five employees they started with in In Pump Meter Service was relocated to its present location in Hopkins Minnesota Woodrich Construction sold out allowing Pump Meter Service to expand on acres In a square foot warehouse and service building was added to the existing sqare foot bldg In a buyout agreement was written between Lee and his two sons and was finalized in Lee after great years retired and now spends the winters at his Arizona home and summers in Minnesota Now a third generation is taking the reins at Pump and Meter Service Inc Kurt Radermacher Joe's son has taken an active role in Sales Management A graduate of Purdue University with a degree in business Kurt brings fresh new energy to sales and marketing He is assembling a new young team in Sales Service and Construction and expanding branch operations in Chippewa Falls WI Bemidji MN and Duluth MN Kurt is currently a minority stock holder with transition plans and buy sell agreements already in place Throughout the unleaded tank boom of the late sixties the mechanical computer pricing upgrades and the gas station self service boom of the late seventies all the way to the age of electronic retrofits to gas pumps the development of the multiple product dispenser MPD and then the business boom of underground tank compliance in the nineties and moving into the new regulations of credit card processing such as EMV European Master Visa mobile payments and Chip and PIN Technology Pump Meter Service has always kept its focus on what s best for its customers and operated accordingly This has been one key to their success and will continue to be in the future as they move into the uncharted waters of renewable and cleaner fueling
