heat transfer equipment for a wide range of commercial and industrial applications Today Fulton employs more than people in facilities in five countries and has served as an industry leader of emerging heat technologies for more than years Family Heritage Global Manufacturing Expanding Capabilities Focused on the Future PURE Technology Lewis Palm Family Heritage Fulton s founder Lewis Palm was a pioneer in the engineering of steam equipment for the laundry and dry cleaning markets In a small garage next to his home in Fulton New York Lewis invented the first Vertical Tubeless Boiler in Upon the receipt of his first sale Lewis tied the boiler to the trunk of his car and drove it hundreds of miles from New York to Michigan Within just a few short years this same boiler would become the most popular model on the market for dry cleaners and launderers nationally and the company founded as a result of that first sale would include approximately employees and a manufacturing facility in Oswego New York The highly skilled staff who fabricated Fulton boilers were ingenuity experts producing an extraordinarily high number of boilers annually approximately in an era before high tech tools and technology were implemented to streamline production The latest innovations and newest technologies continued to capture Lewis interest and steered the direction of Fulton s growth Meanwhile Lewis son Ronald had entered the family business with an eye for expanding product lines In the s Ronald began to develop a version of a thermal fluid heater that was to be the backbone of emerging growth at Fulton Ronald s heater incorporated the interaction of fluid spinning at high velocity with high spin flame hooked up to a hose to monitor the progression of fluid entry Eventually he integrated coils into the design obtained a patent and founded Fulton Thermal Corporation Inc in Lewis grandson and Ronald s son Bram joined the team in the s bringing a third generation of renewed dedication to innovative technologies at Fulton Bram continues to place a strong emphasis on Research Development energy efficiencies global impact and environmental responsibility Back to Top Global Manufacturing Growth and expansion as the direct results of quality products and customer satisfaction paved the way for Fulton s expansion beyond the United States In Fulton established a facility in Bristol England Fulton Ltd Fulton Ltd made it possible to manufacture products more efficiently and assemble completed units for export markets In it expanded its North American operations to include Canada with the founding of Fulton Boiler Works Canada in Toronto Fulton continued its interest in global markets with a venture into Asia in the s In Fulton China in Hangzhou was founded with further Chinese growth in with Fulton Ningbo Fulton China facilities today contribute approximately square feet of manufacturing space to the company Additional growth of Fulton holdings came by way of the purchase of Volcanic Heater in Primarily located in Alliance Ohio Volcanic is a premier manufacturer of heaters for both marine and land based customers Fulton s product offerings during this time had grown to range from steam and hydronic boilers to thermal fluid heaters with a large array of ancillary equipment In an effort to fulfill the growing need for systems integration and controls Fulton established an affiliate company in Synex Controls The integration of cutting edge controls technology with consumer needs has allowed Synex to establish itself as an innovator in the emerging facility HVAC management controls market Contact our Global Facilities Back to Top Expanding Capabilities In Fulton successfully concluded a major facility expansion at its headquarters on Centerville

2	 INTEGRATED PUMP TECHNOLOGY APPOINTED EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR FOR GRINDEX IN SOUTHERN AFRICA SEPTEMBER ADMIN Integrated Pump Technology has been appointed as the exclusive distributor in southern Africa for Grindex the world s third largest submersible pump manufacturer with effect from July Located in Bartlett Boksburg IPT is a pump focused business delivering an improved all round service to its customers It will assume responsibility for the development of the Grindex business in a number of high potential African countries Integrated Pump Technology already has the expertise infrastructure and capabilities to service long standing Grindex customers while growing its pump installation base further Graham Russell executive chairman says Grindex has had a presence in South Africa since the late s most recently through Voith Turbo Our first job since acquiring the agency is to assure the market that it is business as usual We guarantee relationship product service and price structure continuity Integrated Pump Technology is delighted to continue the long association with Grindex in South Africa where it is a household name and we look forward to the challenge of growing the brand in Africa Russell says Russell and his Integrated Pump Technology team consisting of sales service and administration personnel understand the Grindex product range fully The team is fully committed to building on the Grindex success story in Africa he says Located in a new industrial business park close to OR Tambo International Airport Integrated Pump Technology boasts a newly built m warehouse and offices The Grindex certified warehouse holds a comprehensive stock inventory acquired from Voith as well as encompassing a full service repair and kW test tank facility We have an established distribution network of strategically located and specialised pump companies and key account managers whose proximity to our end users provide a fast personal service The warehouse supports the distribution structure in terms of sales repairs and rentals to Botswana Namibia Zambia the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC Mozambique and Zimbabwe Integrated Pump Technology will use its new facility to develop its rental model a new development for Grindex in this market We see the rental business as a big opportunity and are building a significant rental stockholding to service this sector Russell says He explains that Integrated Pump Technology s strategy furthermore is to develop broader product lines and niche non competing premium brands It will also grow the Grindex footprint in a range of industries from mining to construction in keeping with its market segmentation internationally The South African and sub Saharan African markets were the largest export markets for Grindex in and and the second largest in This year is already looking exceptionally good for us driven largely by our exports to Zambia and the DRC There is a full service and test facility in Zambia We are hoping to regain our number one position this year and look on track to do so Russell says Recent flagship contracts include the supply of highly wear resistant Bravo submersible slurry pumps to the DRC and a further submersible Mega N pumps to Zambia In South Africa Grindex has enjoyed a number of successful demonstration test trials in pond dewatering applications in Rustenburg and Richards Bay Research and development takes place at the Grindex head office in Sweden from where new generation pumps are introduced to the market regularly In order to keep up to date with new product lines and innovations Integrated Pump Technology will provide distributor and employee training once a year We will also take our distributors and staff to the Grindex factory in Sweden where they will have access to further training A Grindex representative based in South Africa will provide seamless interaction and communication with Sweden says Russell The main innovations of the Grindex dewatering products are the capability of the sub kW range to run dry This is due to a unique air valve integrated into the pump which allows the impeller to pass air instead of water past the motor in a dry run condition The patented smart motor protector ensures thermal overload phase loss and phase rotation protection The protector and all associated electrical switchgear are installed inside the pump itself meaning there is no need for a control panel with the added benefit of being able to run the pump without supervision The Grindex sludge range has all the advantages of the dewatering range coupled with a recessed vortex impeller and a split hydraulic with replaceable polyurethane linings This makes the sludge units capable of greater solids handling with increased abrasion resistance The lightweight aluminium construction means that these highly portable and robust pumps are ideal for underground face dewatering The dewatering and sludge pumps are also available in cast stainless steel with a capacity of handling pH values between and which means they are ideal for process applications Grindex also manufactures a range of pedigree slurry pumps Boasting a total hard chrome construction of the wet end these units are designed to move medium to heavy slurries with high abrasive content without sacrificing efficiency abrasion resistance or production downtime

2	 Power Equipment Direct was first conceived by Jon Hoch the company's founder after an awful experience shopping for a lawnmower in Hoch wasted an entire Saturday and in gas driving between a half dozen big box superstores and local hardware stores trying to purchase the perfect lawnmower Big Bust The big box stores had a huge selection of lawnmowers collecting dust in a mammoth warehouse After hiking nearly a mile to find the right aisle Hoch finally found the lawnmowers hoisted two stories in the air He tried to round up a sales person to help bring one down so he could read the information on the box The first two ran and hid The third one didn't have a clue He then tried deciphering what remained of the tattered marketing materials which was nearly impossible without being trampled on by the other customers Peaceful Overpriced Frustrated he climbed back into his tiny Saturn and drove across town to the local hardware store to find some solitude That's about all he found Premiere hardware store carried a handful of lawnmowers but the model that he wanted was overpriced and sold out Great He finally found the product he wanted albeit for too much but he couldn't even buy it So he drove to the same store in the next town to purchase it Apparently everyone else in the area had the same idea The store just sold the last one an hour earlier Even if the store had the merchandise Hoch realized that he probably couldn't fit the huge box into his little sedan without scratching half the paint off the door frame Exhausted from shopping Hoch special ordered an overpriced lawnmower paid an enormous amount sales tax and a huge service charge to have it shipped to his house He realized that there's got to be a better way The Birth of a New Company Power Equipment Direct was founded on the premise of simplified shopping Customers could sort through all of the leading power equipment products online from the comfort of their homes no traffic jams no crowds no scratched tailgates Plus all of the equipment including hard to find accessories would ship directly from the factory to the customer's door eliminating the need for stores warehouses and clueless clerks Power Equipment Direct streamlined the sales process and rewarded customers with factory direct discounts and a sales tax free guarantee on its vast selection of products Hoch launched his first web store PressureWashersDirect com from his basement in The goal To sell one pressure washer a week in order to make a car payment Several years and a couple of web stores later Power Equipment Direct is one of the leading online power equipment e tailers with millions of dollars in annual sales The company owns more than a dozen power equipment related web addresses and plans to open more specialty superstores in the very near future

2	 Water treatment and equipment Lowara water pumps ITT Lowara regional distributors for pumps pumping equipment and spare parts Now part of the Zylem group We are official distributors of ITT Lowara pumps and pumping systems Lowara pumps are highly regarded for their reliability efficiency and low running costs We have direct access to the stock and spares lists reducing time for repairs and replacement so you can get back to business and production as soon as possible Some of the types of pumps we can provide are end suction centrifugal close coupled inline pumps multi stage submersible drainage and sewage borehole booster sets and variable speed As we are direct distributors an out of hour s technical advice line is also available Aquada UV Sterilisers We supply and fit UV lamps to control bacteria mainly in spring and borehole water They come in a range of sizes from small domestic to large industrial A UV lamp is of great importance when water which is to be used for human consumption does not come direct from the water undertakers main supply i e it comes from a spring or a borehole Normally a small particle filter will be fitted before the lamp this reduces sediment in the water so the UV rays can penetrate the water to be treated the light then neutralises the bugs and bacteria This is vital because you can t always assume because your water comes from a freshwater spring or bore hole that it is of drinking quality If you own or manage a commercial premises you will usually receive a visit from the local council or Environment Agency who will take water samples and inform you of the water quality and if it is safe to drink Or you may have a private residential home and be cautious of the water supply or even be buying bottled water for drinking and cooking can you really afford to take the risk of poor water quality with your business or home UV sterilizers are easy to fit and as borehole water and spring water is usually free comparatively cheep to buy Private water supplies are covered by the Private water Supply Regulations we can assist you with compliance with this code Water softeners We supply install and service commercial and domestic softeners to suit all applications Simplex duplex time clock and meter controlled softeners Water softeners work by a process known as iron exchange The hard water passes through a high quality cation exchange resin column inside a pressure vessel The resin removes the positively charged Calcium and Magnesium ions from solution and exchanges them for ions of Sodium When the Sodium Irons have been exchanged for Calcium or Magnesium the resin must be regenerated by recharging it using sodium Irons This is a flushing method using salt solution brine this program can be set to happen as and when required Alternatively a meter controlled head can be fitted to ensure regeneration takes place as and when required We also carry out all aspects of service and repair of Siata Fleck Autotrol and Clack valves Resin bed cleaning disinfection including new resin beds if required On site testing for soft water Supply of pre packaged salt Water rams A little known fact regarding water rams is that they use downhill pressure to pump water much higher than it originally started with no other power needed A ft fall is enough to push water up ft above the source These pumps are ideal for rural sites both domestic and commercial Although water rams have been around for hundreds of years and their main design has changed very little they are highly effective and are ideal for environmental use It is a misconception that ram pumps are noisy this is true some are but we can now supply and fit High Lifter Ram Pumps which are considerably quieter it has to be said with these type of pumps the water needs to be cleaner and grit free than for a normal ram If the ram pump you are currently using is faulty we are able to recondition and service it we even make parts for some of the older obsolete pumps in our own workshops Hydraguard is currently a stockist for Blake s and Hydram Water Rams High purity water plant This is either provided by a series of vessels and chemicals or now more commonly via reverse osmosis This is done by filtering the water to be treated through a series of membranes the size of the membrane depends entirely on he clients requirements of water quality This process also reduces the requirement for the use of chemicals to treat water making it more environmentally friendly In many cases after water has passed through a reverse osmosis plant it can either be discharged down a sewer or used in other processes this obviously reduces operating costs by using recycled not raw water Reverse osmosis plants are usually specified with pre treatment forms or process such as softening the water to prevent the membranes scaling up cartridge filters to remove small particles and carbon filtration to remove chlorine All reverse osmosis plants are manufactured to provide a dedicated function for the client and come in various forms of packages and sizes a full range of support and service can also be provided Filtration Designed for specific requirements of domestic or process work Cartridge sand or backwashable resin bed systems From a simple cartridge filter to a large bespoke system capable of several thousand tonnes of water per hour Hydraguard have the expertise to help All parts and spares from stock GRP tank lids Manufacturer of made to measure sectional GRP tank lids and access hatches to enable existing tanks to comply with current ACOP L legislation the current legislation requires all CWST s are fitted with lids and for the larger tanks a man way access hatch as well We provide a range of made to measure lids this is one of our most popular products or services because by law the tanks must conform to the water regulations

how we can help you Noteworth Industry News The wastewater industry has seen tough times in recent years with a combination of low flow urinals and toilets in combination with flushable items This is the latest in examples of how this impacts our municipal systems From ABC News Picture Flushability of Wipes Spawns Class Action Lawsuit March By U JIN LEE Flushable wipes have caused problems in New York City wastewater treatment plants NYC Environmental Protection A New York doctor has filed a federal class action lawsuit against the makers of flushable wipes after experiencing what he claims were major plumbing and clogging issues in his home The defendants should have known that their representations regarding flushable wipes were false and misleading the complaint states The lawsuit by Dr Joseph Kurtz who lives in Brooklyn N Y cites Kimberly Clark and Costco Wholesale corporations and seeks damages of at least million The suit filed on Feb in the Eastern District of New York represents people and claims that consumers around the country have suffered through clogged pipes flooding jammed sewers and problems with septic tanks due to the use of flushable wipes The lawsuit is the latest complaint against the flushable wipes in recent years Over the past five to six years New York City's Department of Environmental Protection has spent over million to have these wipes removed by hand from the sewer system according to Deputy Commissioner Vincent Sapienza When the department looked at the sales of flushable wipes Sapienza said that there was almost a direct correlation between an increase in product sales and an increase in clogs within its sewage treatment facilities The word flushable means it won t clog your toilet or your house but when it gets to a sewage treatment plant the wipes wrap around the equipment shuts it down and then the treatment plant workers go and manually pull these wipes out Sapienza told ABC News on Monday The agency recommends that people not flush these wipes and instead throw them out in the garbage can The wipes market is a billion a year industry with sales growing by to percent annually according to court papers In response to this federal lawsuit Bob Brand a spokesperson for Kimberly Clark the makers of Cottonelle wipes said Kimberly Clark has an extensive testing process to ensure that our flushable wipes products meet or exceed all industry guidelines and we stand behind our claims of flushability A Costco official told ABC News that Costco does not comment on lawsuits While the cleansing cloth packages are labeled as flushable and sewer and septic safe the lawsuit states that there are no legal requirements that a product must meet in order to claim that it is flushable and only voluntary guidelines may be followed at the discretion of manufacturers Experts running public wastewater facilities have independently tested the wipes because there is no legal standard We started doing testing ourselves because we couldn t get any information from the manufacturers said Rob Villee executive director of the Plainfield Area Regional Sewerage Authority in New Jersey Villee who has been working on the testing of these wipes for four years said that when the wipes were put in liters of water the Cottonelle wipes took minutes to disperse while the Costco wipes even after three hours were not totally broken up and there was no noticeable loss of mass Unlike the Cottonelle brand that uses a water soluble binder that breaks down when put in water the Costco brand has a plastic backing sheet on the wipes Villee said I flushed that sucker down times and it still held together he said The Water Environment Federation and the American Public Works Association both nonprofit groups that deal with wastewater issues are expected to meet later this year with product manufacturers to jointly determine what the term flushable should mean Villee said The groups also expected to do more testing on the wipes he said

3	Pump Meter Service Petroleum Equipment and Pump Meter Service Inc history goes back to when a south Minneapolis Minnesota mechanic named Cliff Price began servicing and repairing gas pumps for the local service station market His petroleum fueling service business slowly grew through the Great Depression and as time went on he added several employees Howard Abel from Buffalo Minnesota was one of the hired employees and is significant because he remained a full time employee of Pump Meter Service until when he retired After retiring he worked part time until his death in Abel was just one example of the rich history of great people Pump Meter Service has employed over its year history of petroleum fueling service Cofounders Cliff Price Lee Radermacher Cliff Price the Founder sold out to Ken Wanner in and the petroleum service company was renamed Price Wanner Inc Cliff stayed on as a mentor for the new manager Lee Radermacher until Ken Wanner sold the company to form a group of investors This group went on to become Arrow Tank Company which still exists today in Cambridge Minnesota Cliff Price and Lee Radermacher reacquired complete ownership and renamed the company Pump Meter Service Inc in At this time Pump Meter Service was located at East Franklin in South Minneapolis Cliff continued to serve as a partner and mentor to Lee As time went on the young and eager Lee Radermacher began taking on more responsibilities and assumed more of an active role in Pump Meter Service s direction At the time Pump Meter Service was largely a petroleum service company for several major oil companies They also provided petroleum services to other companies in the Twin Cities such as Northwest Service Station Equipment and Oil Equipment Both these companies sold equipment and hired Pump Meter Service to do the equipment installations By Lee had complete ownership and began a growth process with steady increases in sales year by year Sadly Cliff Price passed away that same year However his tradition of a small family business with quality people was well implanted into Lee s business strategy after years with such an experienced partner in the petroleum service industry In the early years all gas pump lines were serviced and parts were obtained either directly from the factory or from the local distributor Pump Meter Service was a Bowser pump distributor in the fifties and early sixties which at the time was a substantial gas pump manufacturer owned by Keene Corp In Gilbert and Barker Inc later Gilbarco approached Pump Meter Service about becoming a Gilbarco distributor Gilbarco was a strong pump line in the East and South but Bowser was floundering Gilbarco had an almost non existent market share in Minnesota Pump Meter Service took on the Gilbarco line and in conjunction with new and innovative products from Gilbarco proceeded to become the number one petroleum pump line in the Twin Cities This was accomplished not only because of a great product but more importantly by a strong service support network and the assurances from Pump Meter Service to back up its petroleum service products This fact is slowly being lost in today's world of incremental market share and big box sellers As time went on other excellent petroleum equipment lines were added such as Graco Rotary Lift Veeder Root Red Jacket LSI Containment Solutions Xerxes OPW and Franklin Fueling to name a few Pump Meter Service kept adding quality employees who remain to this day the cornerstone of its success In and Lee's sons Joe Radermacher and Tom Radermacher joined the family business bringing engineering and professional talents to the firm which allowed Lee to reduce his time commitment Several key employees were on board at that time namely Ron Komis and Stan Biggen Several more would follow in the ensuing years Mike Eicher Art Staaf Cheryl Simpson Don Krushke Ron Smith Sparky Bejin and numerous others too lengthy to list here Pump Meter Service is very proud of their employees a big change from the five employees they started with in In Pump Meter Service was relocated to its present location in Hopkins Minnesota Woodrich Construction sold out allowing Pump Meter Service to expand on acres In a square foot warehouse and service building was added to the existing sqare foot bldg In a buyout agreement was written between Lee and his two sons and was finalized in Lee after great years retired and now spends the winters at his Arizona home and summers in Minnesota Now a third generation is taking the reins at Pump and Meter Service Inc Kurt Radermacher Joe's son has taken an active role in Sales Management A graduate of Purdue University with a degree in business Kurt brings fresh new energy to sales and marketing He is assembling a new young team in Sales Service and Construction and expanding branch operations in Chippewa Falls WI Bemidji MN and Duluth MN Kurt is currently a minority stock holder with transition plans and buy sell agreements already in place Throughout the unleaded tank boom of the late sixties the mechanical computer pricing upgrades and the gas station self service boom of the late seventies all the way to the age of electronic retrofits to gas pumps the development of the multiple product dispenser MPD and then the business boom of underground tank compliance in the nineties and moving into the new regulations of credit card processing such as EMV European Master Visa mobile payments and Chip and PIN Technology Pump Meter Service has always kept its focus on what s best for its customers and operated accordingly This has been one key to their success and will continue to be in the future as they move into the uncharted waters of renewable and cleaner fueling
